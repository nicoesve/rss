(b) a&lt; q &lt; t &lt; x implies/(t) &lt;p, 
(c) x &lt; t &lt; r &lt; b implies/(t) &gt; p. 
The set of all such triples is countable. Show that each triple is associated with at 
most one point of E. Deal similarly with the other possible types of simple dis-

18. Every rational x can be written in the form x = m/n, where n &gt; 0, and m and n are

Z are compact. DIFFERENTIATION 
In this chapter we shall (except in the final section) confine our attention to real 
functions defined on intervals or segments. This is not just a matter of con&#173;
venience, since genuine differences appear when we pass from real functions to 
vector-valued ones. Differentiation of functions defined on Rk will be discussed 
in Chap. 9. 
THE DERIVATIVE OF A REAL FUNCTION 
5.1 Definition Let/ be defined (and real-valued) on [a, b]. For any x e [a, b] 
form the quotient 
(1) 
and define 
(2) &lt;/&gt;(t) = f(t) -f (x) 
t-x (a &lt; t &lt; b, t =F x), 
f'(x) = lim &lt;/&gt;(t ), 
t&#10132;x 104 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
provided this limit exists in accordance with Definition 4.1. 
We thus associate with the function f a function f' whose domain 
is the set of points x at which the limit (2) exists; f' is called the derivative 
off. 
If f' is defined at a point x, we say that f is differentiable at x. If f' is 
defined at every point of a set E c: [a, b], we say that/ is differentiable on E. 
It is possible to consider right-hand and left-hand limits in (2); this leads 
to the definition of right-hand and left-hand derivatives. In particular, at the 
endpoints a and b, the derivative, if it exists, is a right-hand or left-hand deriva&#173;
tive, respectively. We shall not, however, discuss one-sided derivatives in any 
detail. 
If f is defined on a segment (a, b) and if a&lt; x &lt; b, then f'(x) is defined 
by (1) and (2), as above. Butf'(a) and/'(b) are not defined in this case. 
5.2 Theorem Letf be defined on [a, b]. /ff is differentiable at a point x e [a, b], 
then f is continuous at x. 
Proof As t &#10132; x, we have, by Theorem 4.4, 
f(t) -f(x) , f(t) -f (x) = --- &#8226; (t -x) &gt; f (x) &#183; 0 = 0. t-x 
The converse of this theorem is not true. It is easy to construct continuous 
functions which fail to be differentiable at isolated points. In Chap. 7 we shall 
even become acquainted with a function which is continuous on the whole line 
without being differentiable at any point! 
5.3 Theorem Suppose f and g are defined on [a, b] and are differentiable at a 
point x e [a, b]. Then/+ g, fg, and f/g are differentiable at x, and 
(a) (f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x); 
(b) (fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x); 
(c) f '(x) = g(x)f'(x) -g'(x)f(x).

In (c), we assume of course that g(x) :I= 0. 
Proof (a) is clear, by Theorem 4.4. Leth = fg. Then 
h(t) -h(x) = f(t )[g(t) -g(x)] + g(x)[f(t) -f(x)]. </description></item><item><title>4 Derivatives of Higher Order</title><num_pages>1</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/4_Derivatives_of_Higher_Order.pdf</link><description>100 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

set in X. 
Prove that every continuous open mapping of R1 into R1 is monotonic. 
16. Let [x] denote the largest integer contained in x, that is, [x] is the integer such 
that x -l &lt; [x]:;;; x; and let (x) = x -[x] denote the fractional part of x. What 
discontinuities do the functions [x] and (x) have? 
17. Let/be a real function defined on (a, b). Prove that the set of points at which/ 
has a simple discontinuity is at most countable. Hint: I ... et E be the set on which 
f(x-) &lt;f(x+ ). With each point x of E, associate a triple (p, q, r) of rational 
numbers such that

Prove that f is continuous at every irrational point, and that f l1as a simple discon&#173;
tinuity at every rational point.

We thus associate with the function f a function f' whose domain 
is the set of points x at which the limit (2) exists; f' is called the derivative

If f' is defined at a point x, we say that f is differentiable at x. If f' is

The converse of this theorem is not true. It is easy to construct continuous 
functions which fail to be differentiable at isolated points. In Chap. 7 we shall

and let Ebe a dense subset of X. Prove that f(E) is dense in f(X). If g(p) = f(p) 
for all p e E, prove that g(p) = f(p) for all p e X. (In other words, a continuous 
mapping is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain.) 
5. If/ is a real continuous function defined on a closed set E c R1, prove that there 
exist continuous real functions g on R1 such that g(x) = f(x) for all x e E. (Such 
functions g are called continuous extensions off from E to R1 .) Show that the 
result becomes false if the word ''closed'' is omitted. Extend the result to vector&#173;
valued functions. Hint: Let the graph of g be a straight line on each of the seg&#173;
ments which constitute the complement of E (compare Exercise 29, Chap. 2). 
The result remains true if R1 is replaced by any metric space, but the proof is not 
so simple. 
6. If f is defined on E, the graph off is the set of points (x, /(x)), for x e E. In partic&#173;

the plane. 
Suppose E is compact, and prove that / is continuous on E if and only if 
its graph is compact. 
7. If E c X and if f is a function defined on X, the restriction off to E is the function 
g whose domain of definition is E, such that g(p) =f(p) for p e E. Define/and g 
on R2 by: /(0, 0) = g(O, 0) = 0, j'(x, y) = xy2 /(x2 + y4), g(x, y) = xy2 /(x2 + y6) 
if (x, y) i= (0, 0). Prove that / is bounded on R2, that g is unbounded in every 
neighborhood of (0, 0), and that f is not continuous at (0, O); nevertheless, the 
restrictions of both f and g to every straight line in R2 are continuous! 
8. Let/' be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set E in R1&#8226; Prove 
that f is bounded on E. 
Show that the conclusion is false if boundedness of E is omitted from the 
hypothesis. 
9. Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform continuity can be rephrased 
as follows, in terms of diameters of sets: To every e &gt; 0 there exists a 8 &gt; 0 such 
that diam /(E) &lt; e for all E c X with diam E &lt; 8. 
10. Complete the details of the following alternative proof of Theorem 4.19: If f is not 
uniformly continuous, then for some e &gt; 0 there are sequences {pn}, {qn} in X such 
that dx(Pn, qn) &#9658; 0 but dy(f(pn),f(qn)) &gt; e. Use Theorem 2.37 to obtain a contra&#173;
diction. 
11. Suppose f is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric 
space Y and prove that {/(xn)} is a Cauchy sequence in Y for every Cauchy se&#173;
quence {xn} in X. Use this result to give an alternative proof of the theorem stated 
in Exercise 13. 
12. A uniformly continuous function of a uniformly continuous function is uniformly 
&#8226; continuous. 
State this more precisely and prove it. 
13. Let E be a dense subset of a metric space X, and let/' be a uniformly continuous 
real function defined on E. Prove that f has a continuous extension from E to X 100 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

17. Let/be a real function defined on (a, b). Prove that the set of points at which/

most one point of E. Deal similarly with the other possible types of simple dis-

4.32 Definition For any real c, the set of real numbers x such that x &gt; c is 
called a neighborhood of+ oo and is written (c, + oo ). Similarly, the set ( -oo, c) 
is a neighborhood of -oo. 
4.33 Definition Let f be a real function defined on E c R. We say that 
f(t) &#10132; A as t &#10132; x, 
where A and x are in the extended real number system, if for every neighborhood 
U of A there is a neighborhood V of x such that V n E is not empty, and such 
that/(t) e U for all t e V n E, t &#165;= x. 
A moment's consideration will show that this coincides with Definition

1. Suppose/ is a real function defined on R1 which satisfies 
lim [/(x + h)-f(x- h)] =0 
for every x e R1&#8226; Does this imply that f is continuous? 
2. If/ is a continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y, prove that 
/(E) cf(E) 
for every set E c X. (E denotes the closure of E.) Show, by an example, that 
/(E) can be a proper subset of f(E). 
3. Let /be a continuous real function on a metric space X. Let Z (/) (the zero set of/) 
be the set of all p e X at which /(p) = 0. Prove that Z(/) is closed. 
4. Let / and g be continuous mappings of a metric space X into a metric space Y, CONTINUITY 99 
and let Ebe a dense subset of X. Prove that f(E) is dense in f(X). If g(p) = f(p) 
for all p e E, prove that g(p) = f(p) for all p e X. (In other words, a continuous 
mapping is determined by its values on a dense subset of its domain.) 
5. If/ is a real continuous function defined on a closed set E c R1, prove that there 
exist continuous real functions g on R1 such that g(x) = f(x) for all x e E. (Such 
functions g are called continuous extensions off from E to R1 .) Show that the 
result becomes false if the word ''closed'' is omitted. Extend the result to vector&#173;
valued functions. Hint: Let the graph of g be a straight line on each of the seg&#173;
ments which constitute the complement of E (compare Exercise 29, Chap. 2). 
The result remains true if R1 is replaced by any metric space, but the proof is not 
so simple. 
6. If f is defined on E, the graph off is the set of points (x, /(x)), for x e E. In partic&#173;
ular, if Eis a set of real numbers, and/'is real-valued, the graph of /is a subset of 
the plane. 
Suppose E is compact, and prove that / is continuous on E if and only if 
its graph is compact. 
7. If E c X and if f is a function defined on X, the restriction off to E is the function 
g whose domain of definition is E, such that g(p) =f(p) for p e E. Define/and g 
on R2 by: /(0, 0) = g(O, 0) = 0, j'(x, y) = xy2 /(x2 + y4), g(x, y) = xy2 /(x2 + y6) 
if (x, y) i= (0, 0). Prove that / is bounded on R2, that g is unbounded in every 
neighborhood of (0, 0), and that f is not continuous at (0, O); nevertheless, the 
restrictions of both f and g to every straight line in R2 are continuous! 
8. Let/' be a real uniformly continuous function on the bounded set E in R1&#8226; Prove 
that f is bounded on E. 
Show that the conclusion is false if boundedness of E is omitted from the 
hypothesis. 
9. Show that the requirement in the definition of uniform continuity can be rephrased 
as follows, in terms of diameters of sets: To every e &gt; 0 there exists a 8 &gt; 0 such 
that diam /(E) &lt; e for all E c X with diam E &lt; 8. 
10. Complete the details of the following alternative proof of Theorem 4.19: If f is not 
uniformly continuous, then for some e &gt; 0 there are sequences {pn}, {qn} in X such 
that dx(Pn, qn) &#9658; 0 but dy(f(pn),f(qn)) &gt; e. Use Theorem 2.37 to obtain a contra&#173;
diction. 
11. Suppose f is a uniformly continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric 
space Y and prove that {/(xn)} is a Cauchy sequence in Y for every Cauchy se&#173;
quence {xn} in X. Use this result to give an alternative proof of the theorem stated 
in Exercise 13. 
12. A uniformly continuous function of a uniformly continuous function is uniformly 
&#8226; continuous. 
State this more precisely and prove it. 
13. Let E be a dense subset of a metric space X, and let/' be a uniformly continuous 
real function defined on E. Prove that f has a continuous extension from E to X </description></item><item><title>0 The Derivative of a Real Function</title><num_pages>5</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/0_The_Derivative_of_a_Real_Function.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY 93 
4.21 Example Let X be the half-open interval [O, 2n) on the real line, and 
let f be the mapping of X onto the circle Y consisting of all points whose distance 
from the origin is 1, given by 
(24) f(t) = (cost, sin t) (0 ~ t &lt; 2n). 
The continuity of the trigonometric functions cosine and sine, as well as their 
periodicity properties, will be established in Chap. 8. These results show that 
f is a continuous 1-1 mapping of X onto Y. 
However, the inverse mapping (which exists, since f is one-to-one and 
onto) fails to be continuous at the point (1, 0) = f(O). Of course, X is not com&#173;
pact in this example. (It may be of interest to observe that r-1 fails to be 
continuous in spite of the fact that Y is compact!) 
CONTINUITY AND CONNECTEDNESS 
4.22 Theorem If f is a continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric 
space Y, and if E is a connected subset of X, then f(E) is connected. 
Proof Assume, on the contrary, that/(&#163;)= Au B, where A and Bare 
nonempty separated subsets of Y. Put G =En f-1(A), H =En f-1(B). 
Then E =Gu H, and neither G nor His empty. 
Since Ac A (the closure of A), we have G c/-1(.A); the latter set is 
closed, since/is continuous; hence G c/-1(.A). It follows that/(G) c .A. 
Since f(H) =Band An Bis empty, we conclude that G n His empty. 
The same argument shows that G n His empty. Thus G and Hare 
separated. This is impossible if E is connected. 
4.23 Theorem Let f be a continuous real function on the interval [a, b ]. If 
f(a) &lt;f(b) and if c is a number such that f(a) &lt; c &lt;f(b), then there exists a 
point x e (a, b) such that f(x) = c. 
A similar result holds, of course, if /(a) &gt; f(b). Roughly speaking, the 
theorem says that a continuous real function assumes all intermediate values on 
an interval. 
Proof By Theorem 2.47, [a, b] is connected; hence Theorem 4.22 shows 
that f([a, b ]) is a connected subset of R1, and the assertion follows if we 
appeal once more to Theorem 2.47. 
4.24 Remark At first glance, it might seem that Theorem 4.23 has a converse. 
That is, one might think that if for any two points x1 &lt; x2 and for any number c 
between/(x 1) and/(x 2) there is a point x in (x1, x2) such that/(x) = c, then/ 
must be continuous. 
That this is not so may be concluded from Example 4.27(d). 94 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
DISCONTINUITIES 
If x is a point in the domain of definition of the function f at which f is not 
continuous, we say that/is discontinuous at x, or that/ has a discontinuity at x. 
If f is defined on an interval or on a segment, it is customary to divide discon&#173;
tinuities into two types. Before giving this classification, we have to define the 
right-hand and the left-hand limits offatx, which we denote by/(x+) and/(x-), 
respectively. 
4.25 Definition Let/ be defined on (a, b). Consider any point x such that 
a ~ x &lt; b. We write 
f(x+) =q 
if f(tn) ) q as n ) oo, for all sequences {tn} in (x, b) such that tn ) x. To obtain 
the definition off (x -), for a &lt; x ~ b, we restrict ourselves to sequences { tn} in 
(a, x). 
It is clear that any point x of (a, b), limf(t) exists if and only if 
t&#10132;x 
f(x+) = f(x-) = lim/(t). 
t&#10132;x 
4.26 Definition Let f be defined on (a, b). If f is discontinuous at a point x, 
and if f(x +) and f (x-) exist, then./ is said to have a discontinuity of the first 
kind, or a simple discontinuity, at x. Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of 
the second kind. 
There are two ways in which a function can have a simple discontinuity: 
either f(x+) =/:, f(x-) [in which case the value /(x) is immaterial], or f(x +) = 
f (x - ) =/:-f(x). 
4.27 Examples 
(a) Define 
l f(x) = 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). 
Then/has a discontinuity of the second kind at every point x. since 
neither f (x +) nor/ (x-) exists. 
(b) Define 
/(x) = X 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). CONTINUITY 9S 
Then f is continuous at x = 0 and has a discontinuity of the second 
kind at every other point. 
(c) Define 
X + 2 ( -3 &lt; X &lt; -2), 
f(x) = -x -2 (-2 ~ X &lt; 0), 
X + 2 (0 ~ X &lt; 1). 
Then f has a simple discontinuity at x = 0 and is continuous at 
every other point of ( -3, 1 ). 
(d) Define 
. l s1n-f(x) = X (x &#165;= 0), 
0 (x = 0). 
Since neither f (0 +) nor f (0-) exists, f has a discontinuity of the 
second kind at x = 0. We have not yet shown that sin xis a continuous 
function. If we assume this result for the moment, Theorem 4. 7 implies 
that f is continuous at every point x &#165;= 0. 
MONOTONIC FUNCTIONS 
We shall now study those functions which never decrease (or never increase) on 
a given segment. 
4.28 Definition Let f be real on (a, b). Then f is said to be monotonically 
increasing on (a, b) if a&lt; x &lt; y &lt; b implies f(x) ~f(y). If the last inequality 
is reversed, we obtain the definition of a monotonically decreasing function. The 
class of monotonic functions consists of both the increasing and the decreasing 
functions. 
4.29 Theorem Let f be monotonically increasing on (a, b). Then f(x+) and 
f(x-) exist at every point of x of (a, b). More precisely, 
(25) 
(26) sup f(t) =f(x-) ~f(x) ~f(x+) = inf f(t). 
a&lt;t&lt;x x&lt;t&lt;b 
F1,rthermore, if a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b, then 
f(x+) ~f(y-). 
Analogous results evidently hold for monotonically decreasing functions. 96 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(27) 
(28) 
(29) 
(30) Proof By hypothesis, the set ofnumbersf(t), where a&lt; t &lt; x, is bounded 
above by the number f (x), and therefore has a least upper bound which 
we shall denote by A. Evidently A 5:.f(x). We have to show that 
A =f(x-). 
Let e &gt; 0 be given. It follows from the definition of A as a least 
upper bound that there exists b &gt; 0 such that a &lt; x -b &lt; x and 
A -e &lt;f(x -b) 5:. A. 
Since f is monotonic, we have 
f (x -b) 5:. f (t) 5:. A (x -b &lt; t &lt; x). 
Combining (27) and (28), we see that 
lf(t) -A I &lt; e (x -b &lt; t &lt; x). 
Hencef(x-) = A. -
The second half of (25) is proved in precisely the same way. 
Next, if a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b, we see from (25) that .. 
f(x+) = inf f(t) = inf f(t). 
x&lt;t&lt;b x&lt;t&lt;y 
The last equality is obtained by applying (25) to (a, y) in place of (a, b). 
Similarly, 
f(y-) = sup f(t) = sup f(t ). 
a&lt;t&lt;y x&lt;t&lt;y 
Comparison of (29) and (30) gives (26). 
Corollary Monotonic functions have no discontinuities of the second kind. 
This corollary implies that every monotonic function is discontinuous at 
a countable set of points at most. Instead of appealing to the general theorem 
whose proof is sketched in Exercise 17, we give here a simple proof which is 
applicable to monotonic functions. 
4.30 Theorem Let f be monotonic on (a, b). Then the set of points of (a, b) at 
which f is discontinuous is at most countable. 
Proof Suppose, for the sake of definiteness, that f is increasing, and 
let E be the set of points at which f is discontinuous. 
With every point x of E we associate a rational number r(x) such 
that 
f(x-) &lt; r(x) &lt;fix+). CONTINUITY 97 
Since x1 &lt; x2 implies f(x1 +) ~f(x2 -), we see that r(x1) &#165;= r(x2) if 
X1 :/: X2. 
We have thus established a 1-1 correspondence between the set E and 
a subset of the set of rational numbers. The latter, as we know, is count&#173;
able. 
4.31 Remark It should be noted that the discontinuities of a monotonic 
function need not be isolated. In fact, given any countable subset E of (a, b), 
which may even be dense, we can construct a function f, monotonic on (a, b), 
discontinuous at every point of E, and at no other point of (a, b). 
To show this, let the points of E be arranged in a sequence {xn}, 
n = I, 2, 3,.... Let {en} be a sequence of positive numbers such that I:cn 
converges. Define 
(31) f(x) = L Cn (a&lt; x &lt; b). 
Xn&lt;x 
The summation is to be understood as follows: Sum over those indices n 
for which Xn &lt; x. If there are no points Xn to the left of x, the sum is empty; 
following the usual convention, we define it to be zero. Since (31) converges 
absolutely, the order in which the terms are arranged is immaterial. 
We leave the verification of the following properties off to the reader: 
(a) f is monotonically increasing on (a, b); 
(b) f is discontinuous at every point of E; in fact, 
f(xn+) -f(xn-) =en&#8226; 
(c) f is continuous at every other point of (a, b). 
Moreover, it is not hard to see thatf{x-) =f(x) at all points of(a, b). If 
a function satisfies this condition, we say that f is continuous from the left. If 
the summation in (31) were taken over all indices n for which xn ~ x, we would 
havef(x+) = f(x) at every point of (a, b); that is, f would be continuous from 
the right. 
Functions of this sort can also be defined by another method; for an 
example we ref er to Theorem 6.16. 
INFINITE LIMITS AND LIMITS AT INFINITY 
To enable us to operate in the extended real number system, we shall now 
enlarge the scope of Definition 4.1, by reformulating i&#183;t in terms of neighborhoods.

be any segment (x -b, x + &lt;5). </description></item><item><title>1 Mean Value Theorems</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/1_Mean_Value_Theorems.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY 97 
Since x1 &lt; x2 implies f(x1 +) ~f(x2 -), we see that r(x1) &#165;= r(x2) if

We have thus established a 1-1 correspondence between the set E and 
a subset of the set of rational numbers. The latter, as we know, is count&#173;

INFINITE LIMITS AND LIMITS AT INFINITY 
To enable us to operate in the extended real number system, we shall now 
enlarge the scope of Definition 4.1, by reformulating i&#183;t in terms of neighborhoods. 
For any real number x, we have already defined a neighborhood of x to 
be any segment (x -b, x + &lt;5). 98 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
4.32 Definition For any real c, the set of real numbers x such that x &gt; c is 
called a neighborhood of+ oo and is written (c, + oo ). Similarly, the set ( -oo, c) 
is a neighborhood of -oo. 
4.33 Definition Let f be a real function defined on E c R. We say that 
f(t) &#10132; A as t &#10132; x, 
where A and x are in the extended real number system, if for every neighborhood 
U of A there is a neighborhood V of x such that V n E is not empty, and such 
that/(t) e U for all t e V n E, t &#165;= x. 
A moment's consideration will show that this coincides with Definition 
4.1 when A and x are real. 
The analogue of Theorem 4.4 is still true, and the proof offers nothing 
new. We state it, for the sake of completeness. 
4.34 Theorem Let f and g be defined on E c R. Suppose

Note that oo -oo, 0 &#183; oo, 00/00, A/0 are not defined (see Definition 1.23).
