(22) Next, suppose (15) holds. Keeping y fixed in (18), we can choose 
a point c1 e (a, y) such that g(x) &gt; g(y) and g(x) &gt; 0 if a&lt; x &lt; c1. Multi&#173;
plying (18) by [g(x) -g(y)]/g(x), we obtain 
f(x) &lt; r _ rg(y) +f(y) ( ) a&lt; X &lt; C1 . g(x) g(x) g(x) 
If we let x &gt; a in (20), (15) shows that there is a point c2 e (a, c1) 
such that 
f(x) 
g(x) &lt; q 
Summing up, (19) and (21) show that for any q, subject only to the 
condition A &lt; q, there is a point c2 such thatf(x)/g(x) &lt; q if a&lt; x &lt; c2. 
In the same manner, if -oo &lt; A ~ + oo, and p is chosen so that 
p &lt; A, we can find a point c3 such that 
f(x) 
p &lt; -(a &lt; X &lt; C3), g(x) 
and (16) follows from these two statements. 
DERIVATIVES OF HIGHER ORDER

tiable, we denote the derivative off' by f '' and call/'' the second derivative off 
Continuing in this manner, we obtain functions 
f,f',f'',/(3&gt;, &#183; &#183; &#183; ,f(n), 
each of which is the derivative of the preceding one. J&lt;n&gt; is called the nth deriva&#173;

In order for J&lt;n&gt; (x) to exist at a point x,f&lt;n-l) (t) must exist in a neighbor&#173;
hood of x ( or in a one-sided neighborhood, if x is an endpoint of the interval 
on which f is defined), and J&lt;n -i &gt; must be differentiable at x. Since J&lt;n-i &gt; must 
exist in a neighborhood of x,J&lt;n-2&gt; must be differentiable in that neighborhood. 
TAYLOR'S THEOREM 
-5.15 Theorem Suppose f is a real function on [a, b ], n is a positive integer, 
J&lt;n-l) is continuous on [a, b],f&lt;n&gt;(t) exists for every t e (a, b). Let tx, P be distinct 
points of [a, b ], and define 
n-1/(k)(tx) 
(23) P(t) = L --(t -tx)k. 
k=O k! DIFFERENTIATION 111 
Then there exists a point x between IX and /3 such that 
(24) n. 
For n = 1, this is just the mean value theorem. In general, the theorem 
shows that f can be approximated by a polynomial of degree n -1, and that 
(24) allows us to estimate the error, if we know bounds on lf&lt;n&gt;(x) I&#8226; 
(25) 
(26) 
(27) Proof Let M be the number defined by 
f(/3) = P(/3) + M(/3 -1X)n 
and put 
g(t) =f(t) -P(t) -M(t -1X)n (a~ t ~ b). 
We have to show that n !M = f&lt;n&gt;(x) for some x between IX and /3. By 
(23) and (26), 
(a&lt; t &lt; b). 
Hence the proof will be complete if we can show that g&lt;n&gt;(x) = 0 for some 
x between IX and f3. 
Since p&lt;k&gt;(IX) = [&lt;k&gt;(IX) fork= 0, ... , n -1, we have 
(28) g(IX) = g'(IX) = ''' = g&lt;n-l)(IX) = 0. 
Our choice of M shows that g(/3) = 0, so that g'(x1) = 0 for some x1 
between IX and /3, by the mean value theorem. Since g1(1X) = 0, we conclude 
similarly that g''(x2) = 0 for some x2 between IX and x1. After n steps we 
arrive at the conclusion that g&lt;n&gt;(xn) = 0 for some Xn bet ween IX and Xn _ 1, 
that is, between IX and /3. 
DIFFERENTIATION OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS 
5.16 Remarks Definition 5.1 applies without any change to complex functions 
f defined on [a, b], and Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, as well as their proofs, remain 
valid. If /1 and/2 are the real and imaginary parts of I, that is, if 
f(t) = li(t) + if2(t) 
for a~ t ~ b, where/ 1(t) and/2(t) are real, then we clearly have 
(29) f'(x) = f{(x) + ifi(x); 
also, f is differentiable at x if and only if both /1 and /2 are differentiable at x. </description></item><item><title>6 Differentiation of Vector-valued Functions</title><num_pages>4</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/6_Differentiation_of_Vector-valued_Functions.pdf</link><description>DIFFERENTIATION 111

DIFFERENTIATION OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS 
5.16 Remarks Definition 5.1 applies without any change to complex functions 
f defined on [a, b], and Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, as well as their proofs, remain 
valid. If /1 and/2 are the real and imaginary parts of I, that is, if 
f(t) = li(t) + if2(t) 
for a~ t ~ b, where/ 1(t) and/2(t) are real, then we clearly have 
(29) f'(x) = f{(x) + ifi(x); 
also, f is differentiable at x if and only if both /1 and /2 are differentiable at x. 112 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Passing to vector-valued functions in general, i.e., to functions f which 
map [a, b] into some Rk, we may still apply Definition 5.1 to define f'(x). The 
term &lt;p(t) in (1) is now, for each t, a point in Rk, and the limit in (2) is taken with 
respect to the norm of Rk. In other words, f'(x) is that point of Rk (if there is 
one) for which 
(30) lim f(t) -f(x) -f'(x) = 0, 
t&#10132;x t -X 
and f' is again a function with values in Rk. 
If /1, &#8226;.. , fk are the components off, as defined in Theorem 4.10, then 
(31) f' = (/{, ... ,/;), 
and f is differentiable at a point x if and only if each of the functions /1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , h 
is differentiable at x. 
Theorem 5.2 is true in this context as well, and so is Theorem 5.3(a) and 
{b), if Jg is replaced by the inner product f &#183; g (see Definition 4.3). 
When we turn to the mean value theorem, however, and to one of its 
consequences, namely, L'Hospital's rule, the situation changes. The next two 
examples will show that each of these. results fails to be true for complex-valued 
functions. 
5.17 Example Define, for real x, 
(32) f(x) = eix = cos x + i sin x. 
{The last expression may be taken as the definition of the complex exponential 
eix; see Chap. 8 for a full discussion of these functions.) Then 
(33) 
but 
(34) f(2n) -/(0) = 1 - 1 = 0, 
f'(x) = ieix, 
so that 1/'(x) I = 1 for all real x. 
Thus Theorem 5.10 fails to hold in this case. 
5.18 Example On the segment (0, 1), define/(x) = x and 
(35) g(x) = x + x2eilx2
&#8226; 
Since I eit I = 1 for all real t, we see that 
(36) lim f(x) = 1. 
x&#10132;O g(x) Next, 
(37) 
so that 
(38) 
Hence 
(39) 
and so 
(40) g'(x) = 1 + 2 2i i/x2 x--e 
X (0 &lt; X &lt; 1), 
lu'(x) I ~ 2i 2x-&#173;x 2 -1~--1. 
X 
/'(x) 1 X =--~--g'(x) lu'(x) I 2 -x 
lim f'(x) = 0. 
x&#10132;o g'(x) DIFFERENTIATION 113 
By (36) and ( 40), L'Hospital's rule fails in this case. Note also that g'(x) &#165;: 0 
on (0, 1 ), by (38). 
However, there is a consequence of the mean value theorem which, for 
purposes of applications, is almost as useful as Theorem 5.10, and which re&#173;
mains true for vector-valued functions: From Theorem 5.10 it follows that 
(41) IJ(b) -f(a) I ~ (b -a) sup 1/'(x) 1-
a&lt;x&lt;b 
5.19 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous mapping of [a, b] into Rk and f is 
differentiable in (a, b). Then there exists x E (a, b) such that 
jf(b) -f(a)I ~ (b -a)lf'(x)I. 
Proof1 Putz = f(b) -f(a), and define 
&lt;p( t ) = z &#8226; f( t) ( a ~ t ~ b). 
Then &lt;p is a real-valued continuous function on [a, b] which is differentia&#173;
ble in (a, b). The mean value theorem shows therefore that 
&lt;p(b) -&lt;p(a) = (b -a)&lt;p'(x) = (b &#183;-a)z &#183; f'(x) 
for some x E (a, b). On the other hand, 
&lt;p( b) -&lt;p( a) = z &#183; f( b) -z &#183; f( a) = z &#183; z = I z I 2&#8226; 
The Schwarz inequality now gives 
I z I 2 = ( b -a) I z &#183; f' ( x) I ~ ( b -a) I z I I f' ( x) I . 
Hence lzl ~ (b -a)lf'(x)I, which is the desired conclusion.

proof to the original one. 114 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

L'HOSPITAL'S RULE 
The following theorem is frequently useful in the evaluation of limits. 
5.13 Theorem Suppose/ and g are real and differentiable in (a, b), and g'(x) =I= 0 
for all x e (a, b), where -oo ~a&lt; b ~ + oo. Suppose 
(13)

(14) 
or if 
(15) 
then 
(16) f'(x) 
g'(x) -+&gt; A as x &gt; a. 
f (x) &gt; 0 and g(x) &gt; 0 as x &gt; a, 
g(x) &gt; + oo as x &gt; a, 
f_(x_) -+ A as x &gt; a. 
g(x) 
The analogous statement is of course also true if x &gt; b, or if g(x) -+ -oo 
in (15). Let us note that we now use the limit concept in the extended sense of 
Definition 4.33. 
(17) 
(18) 
(19) Proof We first consider the case in which -oo ~ A &lt; + oo. Choose a 
real number q such that A &lt; q, and then choose r such that A &lt; r &lt; q. 
By (13) there is a point c e (a, b) such that a&lt; x &lt; c implies 
f'(x) 
g'(x) &lt; r. 
If a&lt; x &lt; y &lt; c, then Theorem 5.9 shows that there is a point t e (x, y) 
such that 
f(x) -f(y) f '(t) ----=-&lt;r. g(x) -g(y) g'(t) 
Suppose (14) holds. Letting x-+ a in (18), we see that 
f(y) &lt; &lt; g(y) -r q (a&lt; y &lt; c). 110 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(20) 
(21) 
(22) Next, suppose (15) holds. Keeping y fixed in (18), we can choose 
a point c1 e (a, y) such that g(x) &gt; g(y) and g(x) &gt; 0 if a&lt; x &lt; c1. Multi&#173;
plying (18) by [g(x) -g(y)]/g(x), we obtain 
f(x) &lt; r _ rg(y) +f(y) ( ) a&lt; X &lt; C1 . g(x) g(x) g(x) 
If we let x &gt; a in (20), (15) shows that there is a point c2 e (a, c1) 
such that 
f(x) 
g(x) &lt; q 
Summing up, (19) and (21) show that for any q, subject only to the 
condition A &lt; q, there is a point c2 such thatf(x)/g(x) &lt; q if a&lt; x &lt; c2. 
In the same manner, if -oo &lt; A ~ + oo, and p is chosen so that 
p &lt; A, we can find a point c3 such that 
f(x) 
p &lt; -(a &lt; X &lt; C3), g(x)

(Theorem 4.16). By (12), x e (a, b), and Theorem 5.8 shows that h'(x) = 0. 
If h(t) &lt; h(a) for some t e (a, b), the same argument applies if we choose 
for x a point on [a, b] where h attains its minimum. 
This theorem is often called a generalized mean value theorem; the following 
special case is usually referred to as ''the'' mean value theorem: 
5.10 Theorem If f is a real continuous function on [a, b] which is differentiable 
in (a, b), then there is a point x e (a, b) at which 
f(b) -f(a) = (b -a)f'(x). 
Proof Take g(x) = x in Theorem 5.9. 
5.11 Theorem Suppose f is dijj'erentiable in (a, b). 
(a) Jff'(x) ~ Ofor all x e (a, b), then/ is monotonically increasing. 
(b) Jff'(x) = Ofor all x e (a, b), then/ is constant. 
(c) If f'(x) ~ 0 for all x e (a, b), then f is monotonically decreasing. 
Proof All conclusions can be read off from the equation 
f(x2) -f(x1) = (x2 -X1)f'(x), 
which is valid, for each pair of numbers x1, x2 in (a, b), for some x between 
x1 and x2&#8226; 
THE CONTINUITY OF DERir.ATIVES 
We have already seen [Example 5.6(b)] that a function/may have a derivative 
f' which exists at every point, but is discontinuous at some point. However, not 
every function is a derivative. In particular, derivatives which exist at every 
point of an interval have one important property in common with functions 
which are continuous on an interval: Intermediate values are assumed ( compare 
Theorem 4.23). The precise statement follows. 
5.12 Theorem Suppose f is a real differentiable function on [a, b] and suppose 
f'(a) &lt; l &lt;f'(b). Then there is a point x e (a, b) such that f'(x) = l. 
A similar result holds of course if f'(a) &gt; f'(b). 
Proof Put g(t) = f(t) -lt. Then g'(a) &lt; 0, so that g(t1) &lt; g(a) for some 
t1 e (a, b), and g'(b) &gt; 0, so that g(t2) &lt; g(b) for some t2 e (a, b). Hence 
g attains its minimum on [a, b] (Theorem 4.16) at some point x such that 
a &lt; x &lt; b. By Theorem 5.8, g'(x) = 0. Hence f'(x) = l. DIFFERENTIATION 109 
Corollary If f is differentiable on [a, b ], then f' cannot /1ave any simple dis&#173;
continuities on [a, b ]. 
But/' may very well have discontinuities of the second kind. 
L'HOSPITAL'S RULE 
The following theorem is frequently useful in the evaluation of limits. 
5.13 Theorem Suppose/ and g are real and differentiable in (a, b), and g'(x) =I= 0 
for all x e (a, b), where -oo ~a&lt; b ~ + oo. Suppose 
(13) 
If 
(14) 
or if 
(15) 
then 
(16) f'(x) 
g'(x) -+&gt; A as x &gt; a. 
f (x) &gt; 0 and g(x) &gt; 0 as x &gt; a, 
g(x) &gt; + oo as x &gt; a, 
f_(x_) -+ A as x &gt; a. 
g(x) 
The analogous statement is of course also true if x &gt; b, or if g(x) -+ -oo 
in (15). Let us note that we now use the limit concept in the extended sense of 
Definition 4.33. 
(17) 
(18) 
(19) Proof We first consider the case in which -oo ~ A &lt; + oo. Choose a 
real number q such that A &lt; q, and then choose r such that A &lt; r &lt; q. 
By (13) there is a point c e (a, b) such that a&lt; x &lt; c implies 
f'(x) 
g'(x) &lt; r. 
If a&lt; x &lt; y &lt; c, then Theorem 5.9 shows that there is a point t e (x, y) 
such that 
f(x) -f(y) f '(t) ----=-&lt;r. g(x) -g(y) g'(t) 
Suppose (14) holds. Letting x-+ a in (18), we see that 
f(y) &lt; &lt; g(y) -r q (a&lt; y &lt; c). </description></item><item><title>0 The Derivative of a Real Function</title><num_pages>5</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/0_The_Derivative_of_a_Real_Function.pdf</link><description>DIFFERENTIATION 
In this chapter we shall (except in the final section) confine our attention to real 
functions defined on intervals or segments. This is not just a matter of con&#173;
venience, since genuine differences appear when we pass from real functions to 
vector-valued ones. Differentiation of functions defined on Rk will be discussed 
in Chap. 9. 
THE DERIVATIVE OF A REAL FUNCTION 
5.1 Definition Let/ be defined (and real-valued) on [a, b]. For any x e [a, b] 
form the quotient 
(1) 
and define 
(2) &lt;/&gt;(t) = f(t) -f (x) 
t-x (a &lt; t &lt; b, t =F x), 
f'(x) = lim &lt;/&gt;(t ), 
t&#10132;x 104 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
provided this limit exists in accordance with Definition 4.1. 
We thus associate with the function f a function f' whose domain 
is the set of points x at which the limit (2) exists; f' is called the derivative 
off. 
If f' is defined at a point x, we say that f is differentiable at x. If f' is 
defined at every point of a set E c: [a, b], we say that/ is differentiable on E. 
It is possible to consider right-hand and left-hand limits in (2); this leads 
to the definition of right-hand and left-hand derivatives. In particular, at the 
endpoints a and b, the derivative, if it exists, is a right-hand or left-hand deriva&#173;
tive, respectively. We shall not, however, discuss one-sided derivatives in any 
detail. 
If f is defined on a segment (a, b) and if a&lt; x &lt; b, then f'(x) is defined 
by (1) and (2), as above. Butf'(a) and/'(b) are not defined in this case. 
5.2 Theorem Letf be defined on [a, b]. /ff is differentiable at a point x e [a, b], 
then f is continuous at x. 
Proof As t &#10132; x, we have, by Theorem 4.4, 
f(t) -f(x) , f(t) -f (x) = --- &#8226; (t -x) &gt; f (x) &#183; 0 = 0. t-x 
The converse of this theorem is not true. It is easy to construct continuous 
functions which fail to be differentiable at isolated points. In Chap. 7 we shall 
even become acquainted with a function which is continuous on the whole line 
without being differentiable at any point! 
5.3 Theorem Suppose f and g are defined on [a, b] and are differentiable at a 
point x e [a, b]. Then/+ g, fg, and f/g are differentiable at x, and 
(a) (f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x); 
(b) (fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x); 
(c) f '(x) = g(x)f'(x) -g'(x)f(x). 
g . g2(x) 
In (c), we assume of course that g(x) :I= 0. 
Proof (a) is clear, by Theorem 4.4. Leth = fg. Then 
h(t) -h(x) = f(t )[g(t) -g(x)] + g(x)[f(t) -f(x)]. DIFFERENTIATION 105 
If we divide this by t -x and note that f(t) &gt; f(x) as t &gt; x (Theorem 5.2), 
(b) follows. Next, let h = f/g. Then 
h(t) -h(x) = 1 g(x)f(t) -f(x) _ f(x) g(t) -g(x) . 
t -X g(t )g(x) t -X t -X 
Letting t &gt; x, and applying Theorems 4.4 and 5.2, we obtain (c). 
5.4 Examples The derivative of any constant is clearly zero. If/ is defined 
by f(x) = x, thenf'(x) = 1. Repeated application of (b) and (c) then shows that 
x11 is differentiable, and that its derivative is nx11
-1, for any integer n (if n &lt; 0, 
we have to restrict ourselves to x :I= 0). Thus every polynomial is differentiable, 
and so is every rational function, except at the points where the denominator is 
zero. 
The following theorem is known as the ''chain rule'' for differentiation. 
It deals with differentiation of composite functions and is probably the most 
important theorem about derivatives. We shall meet more general versions of it 
in Chap. 9. 
5.5 Theorem Suppose f is continuous on [a, b],f'(x) exists at some point 
x E [a, b ], g is defined on an interval I tt-&#183;hich contains the range off, and g is 
differentiable at the point f (x). If' 
h(t) = g(f(t)) (a~ t ~ b), 
then h is differentiable at x, and 
(3) h'(x) = g'(f(x))f'(x). 
Proof Let y = f (x). By the definition of the derivative, we have 
( 4) f(t) -f(x) = (t -x)[f'(x) + u(t )], 
(5) 
(6) g(s) -g(y) = (s -y)[g'(y) + v(s)], 
where t e [a, b], s e /, and u(t) &#10132; 0 as t &#10132; x, v(s) &gt; 0 ass &gt; y. Lets =f(t). 
Using first (5) and then ( 4), we obtain 
h(t) -h(x) = g(f(t )) -g(f (x)) 
= [f(t) -f(x)] &#183; [g'(y) + v(s)] 
= (t -x) &#183; [f'(x) + u(t )] &#183; [g'(y) + v(s)], 
or, if t :I= x, 
h(t) -h(x) = [g'(y) + v(s)] &#183; [f'(x) + u(t)]. t-x 
Letting t &gt; x, we see that s &gt; y, by the continuity&#183; off, so that the right 
side of (6) tends to g'(y)f'(x), which gives (3). 106 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

(11) (a) Let/ be defined by 
. 1 
X Slll-f(x) = X (x :I= 0), 
0 (x = 0). 
Taking for granted that the derivative of sin x is cos x (we shall 
discuss the trigonometric functions in Chap. 8), we can apply Theorems 
5.3 and 5.5 whenever x -::/:, 0, and obtain 
'( ) . 1 1 1 f X = SID - --COS -
X X X (x -::/:-0). 
At x = 0, these theorems do not apply any longer, since 1/x is not defined 
there, and we appeal directly to the definition: for t :I= 0, 
f(t) -f(O) . 1 ----= sin - . t-0 t 
As t &gt; 0, this does not tend to any limit, so that f'(O) does not exist. 
( b) Let f be defined by 
2 &#8226; 1 X Slll-f(x) = X (x :I= 0), 
0 (x = 0), 
As above, we obtain 
f'(x) = 2x sin_!_ -cos_!_ 
X X (x :I= 0). 
At x = 0, we appeal to the definition, and obtain 
f(t) -t(o) . 1 I I 1---- = t SID -~ t t-0 t (t :I= O); 
letting t &gt; 0, we see that 
f'(O) = 0. 
Thus f is differentiable at all points x, but f' is not a continuous 
function, since cos (1/x) in (10) does not tend to a limit as x &gt; 0. DIFFERENTIATION 107 
MEAN VALUE THEOREMS 
5.7 Definition Let/ be a real function defined on a metric space X. We say 
that/has a local maximum at a point p e X if there exists~ &gt; 0 such thatf(q) ~ 
f(p) for all q e X with d(p, q) &lt; ~-
Local minima are defined likewise. 
Our next theorem is the basis of many applications of differentiation. 
5.8 Theorem Let f be defined on [a, b]; if f has a local maximum at a point 
x e (a, b), and if f'(x) exists, thenj''(x) = 0. 
The analogous statement for local minima is of course also true. 
Proof Choose~ in accordance with Definition 5.7, so that 
a &lt; x -~ &lt; x &lt; x + ~ &lt; b. 
If x -~ &lt; t &lt; x, then 
f_(t_)_-_f(_x) ~ O.

Letting t &gt; x, we see thatf'(x) ~ 0. 
If x &lt; t &lt; x + ~, then 
f(t) -f(x) 0 ----~' t-x 
which shows that f '(x) ~ 0. Hence f'(x) = 0. 
5.9 Theorem If f and g are continuous real functions on [a, b] which are 
differentiable in (a, b), then there is a point x e (a, b) at a&#183;hich 
(12) [f(b) -f(a)]g'(x) = [g(b) -g(a)]f'(x). 
Note that differentiability is not required at the endpoints. 
Proof Put 
h(t) = [f(b) -f(a)]g(t) -[g(b) -g(a)]f(t) (a~ t ~ b). 
Then h is continuous on [a, b], h is differentiable in (a, b), and 
h(a) = f(b)g(a) -f(a)g(b) = h(b). 
To prove the theorem, we have to show that h'(x) = 0 for some x e (a, b). 
If h is constant, this holds for every x e (a, b). If h(t) &gt; h(a) for 
some t e (a, b), let x be a point on [a, b] at which h attains its maximum </description></item><item><title>1 Mean Value Theorems</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap5/1_Mean_Value_Theorems.pdf</link><description>DIFFERENTIATION 107

5.7 Definition Let/ be a real function defined on a metric space X. We say 
that/has a local maximum at a point p e X if there exists~ &gt; 0 such thatf(q) ~ 
f(p) for all q e X with d(p, q) &lt; ~-
Local minima are defined likewise. 
Our next theorem is the basis of many applications of differentiation. 
5.8 Theorem Let f be defined on [a, b]; if f has a local maximum at a point 
x e (a, b), and if f'(x) exists, thenj''(x) = 0. 
The analogous statement for local minima is of course also true. 
Proof Choose~ in accordance with Definition 5.7, so that 
a &lt; x -~ &lt; x &lt; x + ~ &lt; b. 
If x -~ &lt; t &lt; x, then

Letting t &gt; x, we see thatf'(x) ~ 0. 
If x &lt; t &lt; x + ~, then 
f(t) -f(x) 0 ----~' t-x 
which shows that f '(x) ~ 0. Hence f'(x) = 0. 
5.9 Theorem If f and g are continuous real functions on [a, b] which are 
differentiable in (a, b), then there is a point x e (a, b) at a&#183;hich 
(12) [f(b) -f(a)]g'(x) = [g(b) -g(a)]f'(x). 
Note that differentiability is not required at the endpoints. 
Proof Put 
h(t) = [f(b) -f(a)]g(t) -[g(b) -g(a)]f(t) (a~ t ~ b). 
Then h is continuous on [a, b], h is differentiable in (a, b), and 
h(a) = f(b)g(a) -f(a)g(b) = h(b). 
To prove the theorem, we have to show that h'(x) = 0 for some x e (a, b). 
If h is constant, this holds for every x e (a, b). If h(t) &gt; h(a) for 
some t e (a, b), let x be a point on [a, b] at which h attains its maximum 108 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(Theorem 4.16). By (12), x e (a, b), and Theorem 5.8 shows that h'(x) = 0. 
If h(t) &lt; h(a) for some t e (a, b), the same argument applies if we choose 
for x a point on [a, b] where h attains its minimum. 
This theorem is often called a generalized mean value theorem; the following 
special case is usually referred to as ''the'' mean value theorem: 
5.10 Theorem If f is a real continuous function on [a, b] which is differentiable 
in (a, b), then there is a point x e (a, b) at which 
f(b) -f(a) = (b -a)f'(x). 
Proof Take g(x) = x in Theorem 5.9. 
5.11 Theorem Suppose f is dijj'erentiable in (a, b). 
(a) Jff'(x) ~ Ofor all x e (a, b), then/ is monotonically increasing. 
(b) Jff'(x) = Ofor all x e (a, b), then/ is constant. 
(c) If f'(x) ~ 0 for all x e (a, b), then f is monotonically decreasing. 
Proof All conclusions can be read off from the equation 
f(x2) -f(x1) = (x2 -X1)f'(x), 
which is valid, for each pair of numbers x1, x2 in (a, b), for some x between 
x1 and x2&#8226; 
THE CONTINUITY OF DERir.ATIVES 
We have already seen [Example 5.6(b)] that a function/may have a derivative 
f' which exists at every point, but is discontinuous at some point. However, not 
every function is a derivative. In particular, derivatives which exist at every 
point of an interval have one important property in common with functions 
which are continuous on an interval: Intermediate values are assumed ( compare 
Theorem 4.23). The precise statement follows. 
5.12 Theorem Suppose f is a real differentiable function on [a, b] and suppose 
f'(a) &lt; l &lt;f'(b). Then there is a point x e (a, b) such that f'(x) = l. 
A similar result holds of course if f'(a) &gt; f'(b). 
Proof Put g(t) = f(t) -lt. Then g'(a) &lt; 0, so that g(t1) &lt; g(a) for some 
t1 e (a, b), and g'(b) &gt; 0, so that g(t2) &lt; g(b) for some t2 e (a, b). Hence 
g attains its minimum on [a, b] (Theorem 4.16) at some point x such that 
a &lt; x &lt; b. By Theorem 5.8, g'(x) = 0. Hence f'(x) = l. </description></item></channel>
