4.3 Definition Suppose we have two complex functions,/ and g, both defined 
on E. By f + g we mean the function which assigns to each point x of E the 
number f(x) + g(x). Similarly we define the difference f -g, the product fg, 
and the quotientf/g of the two functions, with the understanding that the quo&#173;
tient is defined only at those points x of E at which g(x) "I:-0. If f assigns to each 
point x of E the same number c, then f is said to be a constant function, or 
simply a constant, and we write f = c. If f and g are real functions, and if 
f(x) ~ g(x) for every x e E, we shall sometimes write f ~ g, for brevity. 
Similarly, if f and g map E into Rk, we define f + g and f &#183; g by 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), (f &#183; g)(x) = f(x) &#8226; g(x); 
and if). is a real number, (lf)(x) = ).f(x). 
4.4 Theorem Suppose E c X, a metric space, p is a limit point of E, f and g 
are complex functions on E, and 
lim f(x) = A, lim g(x) = B. 
x&#10132;p 
Tl1en (a) lim (f + g)(x) = A + B; 
x&#10132;p 
(b) lim (fg)(x) = AB; 
x&#10132;p 
(c) lim [_ (x) = ~, if B "I:-0. 
x&#10132;p g B 
Proof In view of Theorem 4.2, these assertions follow immediately from 
the analogous properties of sequences (Theorem 3.3). 
Remark If f and g map E into Rk, then (a) remains true, and (b) becomes 
(b') lim (f &#183; g)(x) = A &#183; B. 
(Compare Theorem 3.4.) 
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
4.S Definition Suppose X and Y are metric spaces, E c X, p e E, and f maps 
E into Y. Then f is said to be continuous at p if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a 
c5 &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which dx(x, p) &lt; b. 
If f is continuous at every point of E, then f is said to be continuous on E. 
It should be noted that f has to be defined at the point p in order to be 
continuous at p. (Compare this with the remark following Definition 4.1.) 86 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
If p is an isolated point of E, then our definition implies that every function 
f which has E as its domain of definition is continuous at p. For, no matter 
which e &gt; 0 we choose, we can pick b &gt; 0 so that the only point x e E for which 
dx(x,p) &lt;bis x = p; then 
dy(f(x),f(p)) = 0 &lt; e. 
4.6 Theorem In the situation given in Definition 4.5, assume also that p is a 
limit point of E. Then f is continuous at p if and only if limx ... pf(x) = f(p). 
Proof This is clear if we compare Definitions 4.1 and 4.5. 
We now turn to compositions of functions. A brief statement of the 
following theorem is that a continuous function of a continuous function is 
continuous. 
4. 7 Theorem Suppose X, Y, Z are metric spaces, E c X, f maps E into Y, g 
maps the range off, f(E), into Z, and h is the mapping of E into Z defined by 
h(x) = g(f (x)) (x e E). 
If f is continuous at a point p e E anti if g is continuous at the point f(p), then h is 
continuous at p. 
This function his called the composition or the composite off and g. The 
, 
notation 
h =g0f 
is frequently used in this context. 
Proof Let e &gt; 0 be given. Since g is continuous at f(p), there exists 
r, &gt; 0 such that 
d2(g(y), g(f(p))) &lt; e if dy(y,f(p)) &lt; r, and y ef(E). 
Since f is continuous at p, there exists b &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; r, if dx(x, p) &lt;band x e E. 
It follows that 
d2(h(x), h(p)) = d2(g(f(x)), g(f(p))) &lt; e 
if dx(x, p) &lt;band x e E. Thus his continuous at p. 
4.8 Theorem A mapping 1&#183; of a metric space X into a metric space Y is con&#173;
tinuous on X if and only if 1-1 ( V) is open in X for every open set V in Y. 
(Inverse images are defined in Definition 2.2.) This is a very useful charac&#173;
terization of continuity. CONTINUI'l'Y 87 
Proof Suppose/is continuous on X and Vis an open set in Y. We have 
to show that every point of 1-1(V) is an interior point of 1-1(V). So, 
suppose p e X and f (p) e V. Since V is open, there exists e &gt; 0 such that 
ye V if dr(f(p), y) &lt; e; and since f is continuous at p, there exists b &gt; 0 
such that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e if dx(x, p) &lt; b. Thus x ef-1(V) as soon as 
dx(x,p) &lt; b. 
Conversely, suppose f-1(V) is open in X for every open set Vin Y. 
Fix p e X and e &gt; 0, let V be the set of ally e Y such that dr(Y,f(p)) &lt; e. 
Then Vis open; hencef-1(V) is open; hence there exists b &gt; 0 such that 
x ef-1(V)as soon as dx(P, x) &lt; b. But if x e 1-1(V), then f(x) e V, so 
that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e. 
This completes the proof. 
Corollary A mapping f of a metric space X into a metric space Y is continuous if 
and only if f-1 ( C) is closed in X for every closed set C in Y. 
This follows from the theorem, since a set is closed if and only if its com&#173;
plement is open, and sincef-1(Ec) = [f-1(E)]c for every E c Y. 
We now turn to complex-valued and vector-valued functions, and to 
functions defined on subsets of Rk. 
4.9 Theorem Let f and g be complex continuous functions on a metric space X. 
Thenf + g,fg, andf /g are continuous on X. 
In the last case, we must of course assume that g(x) "I:-0, for all x e X. 
Proof At isolated points of X there is nothing to prove. At limit points, 
the statement follows from Theorems 4.4 and 4.6. 
4.10 Theorem 
(7) (a) Let /1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , .h be real functions on a metric space X, and let f be the 
mapping of X into Rk defined by 
f(x) = (Ji(x), ... ,/4(x)) (x EX); 
then f is continuous if and only if each of the functions Ji, ... , /2 is continuous. 
(b) If f and g are continuous mappings of X into Rk, then f + g and f &#183; g 
are continuous on X. 
The functions Ji, ... , /2 are called the components off. Note that 
f + g is a mapping into Rk, whereas f &#8226; g is a real function on X. </description></item><item><title>5 Monotonic Functions</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/5_Monotonic_Functions.pdf</link><description>84 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
if there is a point q e Y with the following property: For every e &gt; 0 there 
exists a o &gt; 0 such that 
(2) d1(f(x), q) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which 
(3) 0 &lt; dx(x,p) &lt; o. 
The symbols dx and dr refer to the distances in X and Y, respectively. 
If X and/ or Y are replaced by the real line, the complex plane, or by some 
euclidean space Rk, the distances dx, dr are of course replaced by absolute values, 
or by norms of differences ( see Sec. 2.16). 
It should be noted that p e X, but that p need not be a point of E 
in the above definition. Moreover, even if p e E, we may very well have 
f(p) f:. limx&#10132;pf(x). 
We can recast this definition in terms of limits of sequences: 
4.2 Theorem Let X, Y, E, f, and p be as in Definition 4. I. Then 
(4) limf(x) =q 
x&#10132;p 
if and only if 
(5) lim f(pn) =q 
n&#10132;oo 
for every sequence {Pn} in E such that 
(6) Pn f:. P, lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
Proof Suppose ( 4) holds. Choose {Pn} in E satisfying (6). Let e &gt; 0 
be given. Then there exists o &gt; 0 such that dr(f(x), q) &lt; e if x e E 
and O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Also, there exists N such that n &gt; N implies 
0 &lt; dx(Pn ,p) &lt; o. Thus, for n &gt; N, we have dy(f(pn), q) &lt; e, which 
shows that (5) holds. 
Conversely, suppose ( 4) is false. Then there exists some e &gt; 0 such 
that for every o &gt; 0 there exists a point x e E (depending on o), for which 
dr(f(x), q) :2:: e but O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Taking on = I/n (n = I, 2, 3, ... ), we 
thus find a sequence in E satisfying (6) for which (5) is false. 
Corollary If f has a limit at p, this limit is unique. 
This follows from Theorems 3.2(b) and 4.2. CONTINUITY 85 
4.3 Definition Suppose we have two complex functions,/ and g, both defined 
on E. By f + g we mean the function which assigns to each point x of E the 
number f(x) + g(x). Similarly we define the difference f -g, the product fg, 
and the quotientf/g of the two functions, with the understanding that the quo&#173;
tient is defined only at those points x of E at which g(x) "I:-0. If f assigns to each 
point x of E the same number c, then f is said to be a constant function, or 
simply a constant, and we write f = c. If f and g are real functions, and if 
f(x) ~ g(x) for every x e E, we shall sometimes write f ~ g, for brevity. 
Similarly, if f and g map E into Rk, we define f + g and f &#183; g by 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), (f &#183; g)(x) = f(x) &#8226; g(x); 
and if). is a real number, (lf)(x) = ).f(x). 
4.4 Theorem Suppose E c X, a metric space, p is a limit point of E, f and g 
are complex functions on E, and 
lim f(x) = A, lim g(x) = B. 
x&#10132;p 
Tl1en (a) lim (f + g)(x) = A + B; 
x&#10132;p 
(b) lim (fg)(x) = AB; 
x&#10132;p 
(c) lim [_ (x) = ~, if B "I:-0. 
x&#10132;p g B 
Proof In view of Theorem 4.2, these assertions follow immediately from 
the analogous properties of sequences (Theorem 3.3). 
Remark If f and g map E into Rk, then (a) remains true, and (b) becomes 
(b') lim (f &#183; g)(x) = A &#183; B. 
(Compare Theorem 3.4.) 
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
4.S Definition Suppose X and Y are metric spaces, E c X, p e E, and f maps 
E into Y. Then f is said to be continuous at p if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a 
c5 &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which dx(x, p) &lt; b. 
If f is continuous at every point of E, then f is said to be continuous on E. 
It should be noted that f has to be defined at the point p in order to be 
continuous at p. (Compare this with the remark following Definition 4.1.) </description></item><item><title>7 Exercises</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/7_Exercises.pdf</link><description>CONTINUI'l'Y 87 
Proof Suppose/is continuous on X and Vis an open set in Y. We have 
to show that every point of 1-1(V) is an interior point of 1-1(V). So, 
suppose p e X and f (p) e V. Since V is open, there exists e &gt; 0 such that 
ye V if dr(f(p), y) &lt; e; and since f is continuous at p, there exists b &gt; 0 
such that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e if dx(x, p) &lt; b. Thus x ef-1(V) as soon as 
dx(x,p) &lt; b. 
Conversely, suppose f-1(V) is open in X for every open set Vin Y. 
Fix p e X and e &gt; 0, let V be the set of ally e Y such that dr(Y,f(p)) &lt; e. 
Then Vis open; hencef-1(V) is open; hence there exists b &gt; 0 such that 
x ef-1(V)as soon as dx(P, x) &lt; b. But if x e 1-1(V), then f(x) e V, so 
that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e. 
This completes the proof. 
Corollary A mapping f of a metric space X into a metric space Y is continuous if 
and only if f-1 ( C) is closed in X for every closed set C in Y. 
This follows from the theorem, since a set is closed if and only if its com&#173;
plement is open, and sincef-1(Ec) = [f-1(E)]c for every E c Y. 
We now turn to complex-valued and vector-valued functions, and to 
functions defined on subsets of Rk. 
4.9 Theorem Let f and g be complex continuous functions on a metric space X. 
Thenf + g,fg, andf /g are continuous on X. 
In the last case, we must of course assume that g(x) "I:-0, for all x e X. 
Proof At isolated points of X there is nothing to prove. At limit points, 
the statement follows from Theorems 4.4 and 4.6. 
4.10 Theorem 
(7) (a) Let /1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , .h be real functions on a metric space X, and let f be the 
mapping of X into Rk defined by 
f(x) = (Ji(x), ... ,/4(x)) (x EX); 
then f is continuous if and only if each of the functions Ji, ... , /2 is continuous. 
(b) If f and g are continuous mappings of X into Rk, then f + g and f &#183; g 
are continuous on X. 
The functions Ji, ... , /2 are called the components off. Note that 
f + g is a mapping into Rk, whereas f &#8226; g is a real function on X. 88 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Proof Part (a) follows from the inequalities 
k i 
11,(x) -f,(y) I =s; I f(x) -f(y) I = L lfi(x) -fi(y) I 2 ' 
t= 1 
for j = I, ... , k. Part (b) follows from (a) and Theorem 4.9. 
4.11 Examples If x1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , xk are the coordinates of the point x e Rk, the 
functions &lt;t,, defined by 
(8) 
are continuous on Rk, since the inequality 
I &lt;Pi(x) -&lt;Pi(Y) I :s; Ix -YI 
shows that we may take b = e in Definition 4.5. The functions &lt;Pt are sometimes 
called the coordinate functions. 
Repeated application of Theorem 4.9 then shows that every monomial 
(9) x:1~2 &#8226; , , x::k 
where n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , nk are nonnegative integers, is continuous on Rk. The same is 
true of constant multiples of (9), since constants are evidently continuous. It 
follows that every polynomial P, given by 
(10) 
is continuous on Rk. Here the coefficients cni&#183;&#183;&#8226;nk are complex numbers, n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , nk 
are nonnegative integers, and the sum in (IO) has finitely many terms. 
Furthermore, every rational function in x1, ... , xk, that is, every quotient 
of two polynomials of the form (10), is continuous on Rk wherever the denomi&#173;
nator is different from zero. 
From the triangle inequality one sees easily that 
(11) I Ix I -I YI I =s; Ix -YI (x, Y e Rk). 
Hence the mapping x ~ Ix I is a continuous real function on Rk. 
If now f is a continuous mapping from a metric space X into Rk, and if &lt;P 
is defined on Xby setting &lt;J,(p) = lf(p)I, it follows, by Theorem 4.7, that &lt;J, is a 
continuous real function on X. 
4.12 Remark We defined the notion of continuity for functions defined on a 
subset E of a metric space X. However, the complement of E in X plays no 
role whatever in this definition (note that the situation was somewhat different 
for limits of functions). Accordingly, we lose nothing of interest by discarding 
the complement of the domain off This means that we may just as well talk 
only about continuous mappings of one metric space into another, rather than </description></item><item><title>2 Continuity and Compactness</title><num_pages>5</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/2_Continuity_and_Compactness.pdf</link><description>NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 75 
Put 
Yn = ao/Jn + a1/Jn-l +'''+an/Jo&#8226; 
We wish to show that Cn &#10132; AB. Since An B &#9658; AB, it suffices to 
show that 
(21) lim Yn = 0. 
Put 
[It is here that we use (a).] Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (c}, /Jn &#9658; 0. Hence we 
can choose N such that I /Jn I ~ e for n ~ N, in which case 
IYnl ~I/Joan+&#183;&#183;&#183;+ fJNan-NI + I/JN+lan-N-1 + &#183;&#183; &#183; + /Jnaol 
~I/Joan+&#183;&#183;&#183;+ fJNan-NI + ea. 
Keeping N fixed, and letting n &#10132; oo, we get 
lim sup I Yn I ~ ea, 
n&#10132;oo 
since ak &#10132; 0 ask&#10132; oo. Since e is arbitrary, (21) follows. 
Another question which may be asked is whether the series ten, if con&#173;
vergent, must have the sum AB. Abel showed that the answer _is in the affirma&#173;
tive. 
3.51 Theorem If the series tan, tbn, ten converge to A, B, C, and 
Cn = ao bn + ... + an ho' then C = AB. 
Here no assumption is made concerning absolute convergence. We shall 
give a simple proof (which depends on the continuity of power series) after 
Theorem 8.2. 
REARRANGEMENTS 
3.52 Definition Let {kn}, n = 1, 2, 3, ... , be a sequence in which every 
positive integer appears once and only once (that is, {kn} is a 1-1 function from 
J onto J, in the notation of Definition 2.2). Putting 
' a = ak n " (n=l,2,3, ... ), 
we say that ta~ is a rearrangement of tan . 76 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
If {sn}, {s~} are the sequences of partial sums of tan, ta~, it is easily seen 
that, in general, these two sequences consist of entirely different numbers. 
We are thus led to the problem of determining under what conditions all 
rearrangements of a convergent series will converge and whether the sums are 
necessarily the same. 
3.53 Example Consider the convergent series 
(22) 1-&#189;+&#188;-&#188;+&#189;--l;+&#183;&#183;&#183; 
and one of its rearrangements 
(23) 1 + &#188; -&#189; + t + t -&#188; + &#189; + 111 -&#188; + ... 
in which two positive terms are always followed by one negative. If s is the 
sum of (22), then 
s &lt; 1 -&#189; + &#189; = i, 
Since 
1 1 1 
- 3 + 4k -1 -2k &gt; O 
for k ~ 1, we see that s; &lt; s~ &lt; s~ &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183; , where s~ is nth partial sum of (23). 
Hence 
1. , , _S_ Im sup Sn &gt; S3 = 0, 
n&#10132;oo 
so that (23) certainly does not converge to s [we leave it to the reader to verify 
that (23) does, however, converge]. 
This example illustrates the following theorem, due to Riemann. 
3.54 Theorem Let tan be a ,fleries of real numbers which converges, but not 
absolutely. Suppose 
-00 ~ CX ~ p ~ 00. 
Then there exists a rearrangement ta~ with partial sums s~ such that 
(24) lim inf s~ = ex, lim sups~ = p. 
n&#10132;oo n&#10132;oo 
Proof Let 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 77 
Then Pn -qn = an, Pn + qn = I an I, Pn ~ 0, qn ~ 0. The series "'f.pn, "'f.qn 
must both diverge. 
For if both were convergent, then 
would converge, contrary to hypothesis. Since 
N N N N L an = L (Pn -qn) = L Pn -L qn, 
n=1 n=1 n=1 n=1 
divergence of "'f.pn and convergence of "'f.qn ( or vice versa) implies diver&#173;
gence of "'f.an , again contrary to hypothesis. 
Now let P1, P2, P3, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; denote the nonnegative terms of "'f.an, in the 
order in which they occur, and let Q1, Q2, Q3, .&#8226;. be the absolute values 
of the negative terms of "'f.an, also in their original order. 
The series "'f.Pn, "'f.Qn differ from "'f.pn, "'f.qn only by zero terms, and 
are therefore divergent. 
We shall construct sequences {mn}, {kn}, such that the series 
(25) P1 + &#183;&#8226;&#183; +P,,,1 -Q1 -&#183;&#183;&#183; -Qk1 +Pm1+1 + &#183;&#183;&#183; 
+Pm2 -Qk1+1 -&#183;&#183;&#8226; -Qk2 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;, 
which clearly is a rearrangement of "'f.an, satisfies (24). 
Choose real-valued sequences {C&lt;n}, {/3n} such that C&lt;n---+ C&lt;, /3n---+ /3, 
an &lt; Pn, /31 &gt; o. 
Let m1, k1 be the smallest integers such that 
P1 + &#183;&#183;&#183; +Pm1 &gt; /31, 
P1 + &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; + P m1 -Ql -&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; -Qk1 &lt; C(l; 
let m2, k2 be the smallest integers such that 
P1 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +Pm1 -Q1 -&#8226;&#183;&#8226; -Qk1 +P,,,1+1 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +Pm2 &gt; /32, 
P1 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +P,n1 -Q1 -&#183;&#8226;&#8226; -Qk1 +Pm1+l + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +Pm2 -Qk1+l 
-... -Qk2 &lt; C&lt;2; 
and continue in this way. This is possible since "'f.Pn and "'f.Qn diverge. 
If xn, Yn denote the partial sums of (25) whose last terms are Pm", 
-Qkn, then 
Since Pn---+ 0 and Qn---+ 0 as n---+ oo, we see that Xn---+ /3, Yn---+ C(. 
Finally, it is clear that no number less than C&lt; or greater than /3 can 
be a subsequential limit of the partial sums of (25). 78 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
3.SS Theorem lf"f.an is a series of complex numbers which converges absolutely, 
then every rearrangement of "f.an converges, and they all converge to the same sum. 
Proof Let "f.a~ be a rearrangement, with partial sums s~. Given e &gt; 0, 
there exists an integer N such that m ~ n ~ N implies 
(26) 
&#8226; 1=n 
Now choose p such that the integers 1, 2, ... , N are all contained in the 
set k1, k2, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , kP (we use the notation of Definition 3.52). Then if n &gt; p, 
the numbers a1, ... , aN will cancel in the difference sn -s~, so that 
I sn -s~ I ~ e, by (26). Hence {s~} converges to the same sum as {sn}.

Thus two convergent series may be added term by term, and the result&#173;
ing series converges to the sum of the two series. The situation becomes more 
complicated when we consider multiplication of two series. To begin with, we 
have to define the product. This can be done in several ways; we shall consider 
the so-called ''Cauchy product." 
3.48 Definition Given La" and Lb", we put 
" en= L akbn-k 
k=O (n=0,1,2, ... ) 
and call LC" the product of the two given series. 
This definition may be motivated as follows. If we take two power 
series Lanz" and "'&#163;b"z", multiply them term by term, and collect terms contain&#173;
ing the same power of z, we get 
00 00 L a" z" &#183; L bn z" = (a0 + a1z + a2 z2 + &#183; &#183; &#183;)(b0 + b1z + b2 z2 + &#183; &#183; &#183;) 
n=O n=O

= Co + C 1 Z + C 2 z2 + ' ' ' . 
Setting z = 1, we arrive at the above definition. 
3.49 Example If 
and A" &#10132; A, B" &#10132; B, then it is not at all clear that { C"} will converge to AB, 
since we do not have C" = A" B". The dependence of { C"} on {A"} and {.B"} is 
quite a complicated one (see the proof of Theorem 3.50). We shall now show 
that the product of two convergent series may actually diverge. 
The series

not satisfied. 
In view of the next theorem, due to Mertens, we note that we have here 
considered the product of two nonabsolutely convergent series.

That is, the product of two convergent series converges, and to the right 
value, if at least one of the two series converges absolutely. 
Proof Put 
Then 
Cn = aobo + (aob1 + a1bo) + &#183; &#183; &#183; + (aobn + a1bn-1 + &#183; &#183;&#183; + anbo)

Put 
Yn = ao/Jn + a1/Jn-l +'''+an/Jo&#8226; 
We wish to show that Cn &#10132; AB. Since An B &#9658; AB, it suffices to 
show that 
(21) lim Yn = 0. 
Put 
[It is here that we use (a).] Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (c}, /Jn &#9658; 0. Hence we 
can choose N such that I /Jn I ~ e for n ~ N, in which case 
IYnl ~I/Joan+&#183;&#183;&#183;+ fJNan-NI + I/JN+lan-N-1 + &#183;&#183; &#183; + /Jnaol

Keeping N fixed, and letting n &#10132; oo, we get 
lim sup I Yn I ~ ea, 
n&#10132;oo 
since ak &#10132; 0 ask&#10132; oo. Since e is arbitrary, (21) follows. 
Another question which may be asked is whether the series ten, if con&#173;
vergent, must have the sum AB. Abel showed that the answer _is in the affirma&#173;
tive. 
3.51 Theorem If the series tan, tbn, ten converge to A, B, C, and 
Cn = ao bn + ... + an ho' then C = AB. 
Here no assumption is made concerning absolute convergence. We shall 
give a simple proof (which depends on the continuity of power series) after 
Theorem 8.2.

LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS 
4.1 Definition Let X and Y be metric spaces; suppose E c X, f maps E into 
Y, and p is a limit point of E. We write f(x) ~ q as x ~ p, or 
(1) lim/(x) = q 
x&#10132;p 84 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
if there is a point q e Y with the following property: For every e &gt; 0 there 
exists a o &gt; 0 such that 
(2) d1(f(x), q) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which 
(3) 0 &lt; dx(x,p) &lt; o. 
The symbols dx and dr refer to the distances in X and Y, respectively. 
If X and/ or Y are replaced by the real line, the complex plane, or by some 
euclidean space Rk, the distances dx, dr are of course replaced by absolute values, 
or by norms of differences ( see Sec. 2.16). 
It should be noted that p e X, but that p need not be a point of E 
in the above definition. Moreover, even if p e E, we may very well have 
f(p) f:. limx&#10132;pf(x). 
We can recast this definition in terms of limits of sequences: 
4.2 Theorem Let X, Y, E, f, and p be as in Definition 4. I. Then 
(4) limf(x) =q 
x&#10132;p 
if and only if 
(5) lim f(pn) =q 
n&#10132;oo 
for every sequence {Pn} in E such that 
(6) Pn f:. P, lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
Proof Suppose ( 4) holds. Choose {Pn} in E satisfying (6). Let e &gt; 0 
be given. Then there exists o &gt; 0 such that dr(f(x), q) &lt; e if x e E 
and O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Also, there exists N such that n &gt; N implies 
0 &lt; dx(Pn ,p) &lt; o. Thus, for n &gt; N, we have dy(f(pn), q) &lt; e, which 
shows that (5) holds. 
Conversely, suppose ( 4) is false. Then there exists some e &gt; 0 such 
that for every o &gt; 0 there exists a point x e E (depending on o), for which 
dr(f(x), q) :2:: e but O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Taking on = I/n (n = I, 2, 3, ... ), we 
thus find a sequence in E satisfying (6) for which (5) is false. 
Corollary If f has a limit at p, this limit is unique. 
This follows from Theorems 3.2(b) and 4.2. </description></item><item><title>0 Limits of Functions</title><num_pages>1</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/0_Limits_of_Functions.pdf</link><description>NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 73
