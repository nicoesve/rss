Then f is continuous at x = 0 and has a discontinuity of the second 
kind at every other point. 
(c) Define 
X + 2 ( -3 &lt; X &lt; -2), 
f(x) = -x -2 (-2 ~ X &lt; 0), 
X + 2 (0 ~ X &lt; 1). 
Then f has a simple discontinuity at x = 0 and is continuous at 
every other point of ( -3, 1 ). 
(d) Define 
. l s1n-f(x) = X (x &#165;= 0), 
0 (x = 0). 
Since neither f (0 +) nor f (0-) exists, f has a discontinuity of the 
second kind at x = 0. We have not yet shown that sin xis a continuous 
function. If we assume this result for the moment, Theorem 4. 7 implies 
that f is continuous at every point x &#165;= 0. 
MONOTONIC FUNCTIONS 
We shall now study those functions which never decrease (or never increase) on 
a given segment. 
4.28 Definition Let f be real on (a, b). Then f is said to be monotonically 
increasing on (a, b) if a&lt; x &lt; y &lt; b implies f(x) ~f(y). If the last inequality 
is reversed, we obtain the definition of a monotonically decreasing function. The 
class of monotonic functions consists of both the increasing and the decreasing 
functions. 
4.29 Theorem Let f be monotonically increasing on (a, b). Then f(x+) and 
f(x-) exist at every point of x of (a, b). More precisely, 
(25) 
(26) sup f(t) =f(x-) ~f(x) ~f(x+) = inf f(t). 
a&lt;t&lt;x x&lt;t&lt;b 
F1,rthermore, if a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b, then 
f(x+) ~f(y-). 
Analogous results evidently hold for monotonically decreasing functions. 96 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

(30) Proof By hypothesis, the set ofnumbersf(t), where a&lt; t &lt; x, is bounded 
above by the number f (x), and therefore has a least upper bound which 
we shall denote by A. Evidently A 5:.f(x). We have to show that 
A =f(x-). 
Let e &gt; 0 be given. It follows from the definition of A as a least 
upper bound that there exists b &gt; 0 such that a &lt; x -b &lt; x and 
A -e &lt;f(x -b) 5:. A. 
Since f is monotonic, we have 
f (x -b) 5:. f (t) 5:. A (x -b &lt; t &lt; x). 
Combining (27) and (28), we see that 
lf(t) -A I &lt; e (x -b &lt; t &lt; x). 
Hencef(x-) = A. -
The second half of (25) is proved in precisely the same way. 
Next, if a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b, we see from (25) that .. 
f(x+) = inf f(t) = inf f(t). 
x&lt;t&lt;b x&lt;t&lt;y 
The last equality is obtained by applying (25) to (a, y) in place of (a, b). 
Similarly, 
f(y-) = sup f(t) = sup f(t ). 
a&lt;t&lt;y x&lt;t&lt;y 
Comparison of (29) and (30) gives (26). 
Corollary Monotonic functions have no discontinuities of the second kind. 
This corollary implies that every monotonic function is discontinuous at 
a countable set of points at most. Instead of appealing to the general theorem 
whose proof is sketched in Exercise 17, we give here a simple proof which is 
applicable to monotonic functions. 
4.30 Theorem Let f be monotonic on (a, b). Then the set of points of (a, b) at 
which f is discontinuous is at most countable. 
Proof Suppose, for the sake of definiteness, that f is increasing, and 
let E be the set of points at which f is discontinuous. 
With every point x of E we associate a rational number r(x) such 
that 
f(x-) &lt; r(x) &lt;fix+). CONTINUITY 97 
Since x1 &lt; x2 implies f(x1 +) ~f(x2 -), we see that r(x1) &#165;= r(x2) if 
X1 :/: X2. 
We have thus established a 1-1 correspondence between the set E and 
a subset of the set of rational numbers. The latter, as we know, is count&#173;
able. 
4.31 Remark It should be noted that the discontinuities of a monotonic 
function need not be isolated. In fact, given any countable subset E of (a, b), 
which may even be dense, we can construct a function f, monotonic on (a, b), 
discontinuous at every point of E, and at no other point of (a, b). 
To show this, let the points of E be arranged in a sequence {xn}, 
n = I, 2, 3,.... Let {en} be a sequence of positive numbers such that I:cn 
converges. Define 
(31) f(x) = L Cn (a&lt; x &lt; b). 
Xn&lt;x 
The summation is to be understood as follows: Sum over those indices n 
for which Xn &lt; x. If there are no points Xn to the left of x, the sum is empty; 
following the usual convention, we define it to be zero. Since (31) converges 
absolutely, the order in which the terms are arranged is immaterial. 
We leave the verification of the following properties off to the reader: 
(a) f is monotonically increasing on (a, b); 
(b) f is discontinuous at every point of E; in fact, 
f(xn+) -f(xn-) =en&#8226; 
(c) f is continuous at every other point of (a, b). 
Moreover, it is not hard to see thatf{x-) =f(x) at all points of(a, b). If 
a function satisfies this condition, we say that f is continuous from the left. If 
the summation in (31) were taken over all indices n for which xn ~ x, we would 
havef(x+) = f(x) at every point of (a, b); that is, f would be continuous from 
the right. 
Functions of this sort can also be defined by another method; for an 
example we ref er to Theorem 6.16. 
INFINITE LIMITS AND LIMITS AT INFINITY 
To enable us to operate in the extended real number system, we shall now 
enlarge the scope of Definition 4.1, by reformulating i&#183;t in terms of neighborhoods. 
For any real number x, we have already defined a neighborhood of x to 
be any segment (x -b, x + &lt;5). </description></item><item><title>5 Monotonic Functions</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/5_Monotonic_Functions.pdf</link><description>94 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
DISCONTINUITIES 
If x is a point in the domain of definition of the function f at which f is not 
continuous, we say that/is discontinuous at x, or that/ has a discontinuity at x. 
If f is defined on an interval or on a segment, it is customary to divide discon&#173;
tinuities into two types. Before giving this classification, we have to define the 
right-hand and the left-hand limits offatx, which we denote by/(x+) and/(x-), 
respectively. 
4.25 Definition Let/ be defined on (a, b). Consider any point x such that 
a ~ x &lt; b. We write 
f(x+) =q 
if f(tn) ) q as n ) oo, for all sequences {tn} in (x, b) such that tn ) x. To obtain 
the definition off (x -), for a &lt; x ~ b, we restrict ourselves to sequences { tn} in 
(a, x). 
It is clear that any point x of (a, b), limf(t) exists if and only if 
t&#10132;x 
f(x+) = f(x-) = lim/(t). 
t&#10132;x 
4.26 Definition Let f be defined on (a, b). If f is discontinuous at a point x, 
and if f(x +) and f (x-) exist, then./ is said to have a discontinuity of the first 
kind, or a simple discontinuity, at x. Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of 
the second kind. 
There are two ways in which a function can have a simple discontinuity: 
either f(x+) =/:, f(x-) [in which case the value /(x) is immaterial], or f(x +) = 
f (x - ) =/:-f(x). 
4.27 Examples 
(a) Define 
l f(x) = 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). 
Then/has a discontinuity of the second kind at every point x. since 
neither f (x +) nor/ (x-) exists. 
(b) Define 
/(x) = X 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). CONTINUITY 9S 
Then f is continuous at x = 0 and has a discontinuity of the second 
kind at every other point. 
(c) Define 
X + 2 ( -3 &lt; X &lt; -2), 
f(x) = -x -2 (-2 ~ X &lt; 0), 
X + 2 (0 ~ X &lt; 1). 
Then f has a simple discontinuity at x = 0 and is continuous at 
every other point of ( -3, 1 ). 
(d) Define 
. l s1n-f(x) = X (x &#165;= 0), 
0 (x = 0). 
Since neither f (0 +) nor f (0-) exists, f has a discontinuity of the 
second kind at x = 0. We have not yet shown that sin xis a continuous 
function. If we assume this result for the moment, Theorem 4. 7 implies 
that f is continuous at every point x &#165;= 0. 
MONOTONIC FUNCTIONS 
We shall now study those functions which never decrease (or never increase) on 
a given segment. 
4.28 Definition Let f be real on (a, b). Then f is said to be monotonically 
increasing on (a, b) if a&lt; x &lt; y &lt; b implies f(x) ~f(y). If the last inequality 
is reversed, we obtain the definition of a monotonically decreasing function. The 
class of monotonic functions consists of both the increasing and the decreasing 
functions. 
4.29 Theorem Let f be monotonically increasing on (a, b). Then f(x+) and 
f(x-) exist at every point of x of (a, b). More precisely, 
(25) 
(26) sup f(t) =f(x-) ~f(x) ~f(x+) = inf f(t). 
a&lt;t&lt;x x&lt;t&lt;b 
F1,rthermore, if a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b, then 
f(x+) ~f(y-). 
Analogous results evidently hold for monotonically decreasing functions. </description></item><item><title>7 Exercises</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/7_Exercises.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY 97 
Since x1 &lt; x2 implies f(x1 +) ~f(x2 -), we see that r(x1) &#165;= r(x2) if 
X1 :/: X2. 
We have thus established a 1-1 correspondence between the set E and 
a subset of the set of rational numbers. The latter, as we know, is count&#173;

INFINITE LIMITS AND LIMITS AT INFINITY 
To enable us to operate in the extended real number system, we shall now 
enlarge the scope of Definition 4.1, by reformulating i&#183;t in terms of neighborhoods. 
For any real number x, we have already defined a neighborhood of x to 
be any segment (x -b, x + &lt;5). 98 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
4.32 Definition For any real c, the set of real numbers x such that x &gt; c is 
called a neighborhood of+ oo and is written (c, + oo ). Similarly, the set ( -oo, c) 
is a neighborhood of -oo. 
4.33 Definition Let f be a real function defined on E c R. We say that 
f(t) &#10132; A as t &#10132; x, 
where A and x are in the extended real number system, if for every neighborhood 
U of A there is a neighborhood V of x such that V n E is not empty, and such 
that/(t) e U for all t e V n E, t &#165;= x. 
A moment's consideration will show that this coincides with Definition 
4.1 when A and x are real. 
The analogue of Theorem 4.4 is still true, and the proof offers nothing 
new. We state it, for the sake of completeness. 
4.34 Theorem Let f and g be defined on E c R. Suppose 
Then f(t) &#10132; A, 
(a) f(t) ) A' implies A' = A. 
(b) (f + g)(t) ) A + B, 
(c) (fg)(t) ) AB, 
(d) (f /g)(t) ) A/B, as t &#10132; x. 
provided the right members of (b), (c), and (d) are defined. 
Note that oo -oo, 0 &#183; oo, 00/00, A/0 are not defined (see Definition 1.23). 
EXERCISES 
1. Suppose/ is a real function defined on R1 which satisfies 
lim [/(x + h)-f(x- h)] =0 
for every x e R1&#8226; Does this imply that f is continuous? 
2. If/ is a continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y, prove that 
/(E) cf(E) 
for every set E c X. (E denotes the closure of E.) Show, by an example, that 
/(E) can be a proper subset of f(E). 
3. Let /be a continuous real function on a metric space X. Let Z (/) (the zero set of/) 
be the set of all p e X at which /(p) = 0. Prove that Z(/) is closed.

4.3 Definition Suppose we have two complex functions,/ and g, both defined 
on E. By f + g we mean the function which assigns to each point x of E the 
number f(x) + g(x). Similarly we define the difference f -g, the product fg, 
and the quotientf/g of the two functions, with the understanding that the quo&#173;
tient is defined only at those points x of E at which g(x) "I:-0. If f assigns to each 
point x of E the same number c, then f is said to be a constant function, or 
simply a constant, and we write f = c. If f and g are real functions, and if 
f(x) ~ g(x) for every x e E, we shall sometimes write f ~ g, for brevity. 
Similarly, if f and g map E into Rk, we define f + g and f &#183; g by 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), (f &#183; g)(x) = f(x) &#8226; g(x); 
and if). is a real number, (lf)(x) = ).f(x). 
4.4 Theorem Suppose E c X, a metric space, p is a limit point of E, f and g 
are complex functions on E, and 
lim f(x) = A, lim g(x) = B. 
x&#10132;p 
Tl1en (a) lim (f + g)(x) = A + B; 
x&#10132;p 
(b) lim (fg)(x) = AB; 
x&#10132;p 
(c) lim [_ (x) = ~, if B "I:-0. 
x&#10132;p g B 
Proof In view of Theorem 4.2, these assertions follow immediately from 
the analogous properties of sequences (Theorem 3.3). 
Remark If f and g map E into Rk, then (a) remains true, and (b) becomes 
(b') lim (f &#183; g)(x) = A &#183; B. 
(Compare Theorem 3.4.) 
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
4.S Definition Suppose X and Y are metric spaces, E c X, p e E, and f maps 
E into Y. Then f is said to be continuous at p if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a 
c5 &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which dx(x, p) &lt; b. 
If f is continuous at every point of E, then f is said to be continuous on E. 
It should be noted that f has to be defined at the point p in order to be 
continuous at p. (Compare this with the remark following Definition 4.1.) 86 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
If p is an isolated point of E, then our definition implies that every function 
f which has E as its domain of definition is continuous at p. For, no matter 
which e &gt; 0 we choose, we can pick b &gt; 0 so that the only point x e E for which 
dx(x,p) &lt;bis x = p; then 
dy(f(x),f(p)) = 0 &lt; e. 
4.6 Theorem In the situation given in Definition 4.5, assume also that p is a 
limit point of E. Then f is continuous at p if and only if limx ... pf(x) = f(p). 
Proof This is clear if we compare Definitions 4.1 and 4.5. 
We now turn to compositions of functions. A brief statement of the 
following theorem is that a continuous function of a continuous function is 
continuous. 
4. 7 Theorem Suppose X, Y, Z are metric spaces, E c X, f maps E into Y, g 
maps the range off, f(E), into Z, and h is the mapping of E into Z defined by 
h(x) = g(f (x)) (x e E). 
If f is continuous at a point p e E anti if g is continuous at the point f(p), then h is 
continuous at p. 
This function his called the composition or the composite off and g. The 
, 
notation 
h =g0f 
is frequently used in this context. 
Proof Let e &gt; 0 be given. Since g is continuous at f(p), there exists 
r, &gt; 0 such that 
d2(g(y), g(f(p))) &lt; e if dy(y,f(p)) &lt; r, and y ef(E). 
Since f is continuous at p, there exists b &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; r, if dx(x, p) &lt;band x e E. 
It follows that 
d2(h(x), h(p)) = d2(g(f(x)), g(f(p))) &lt; e 
if dx(x, p) &lt;band x e E. Thus his continuous at p. 
4.8 Theorem A mapping 1&#183; of a metric space X into a metric space Y is con&#173;
tinuous on X if and only if 1-1 ( V) is open in X for every open set V in Y. 
(Inverse images are defined in Definition 2.2.) This is a very useful charac&#173;
terization of continuity. CONTINUI'l'Y 87 
Proof Suppose/is continuous on X and Vis an open set in Y. We have 
to show that every point of 1-1(V) is an interior point of 1-1(V). So, 
suppose p e X and f (p) e V. Since V is open, there exists e &gt; 0 such that 
ye V if dr(f(p), y) &lt; e; and since f is continuous at p, there exists b &gt; 0 
such that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e if dx(x, p) &lt; b. Thus x ef-1(V) as soon as 
dx(x,p) &lt; b. 
Conversely, suppose f-1(V) is open in X for every open set Vin Y. 
Fix p e X and e &gt; 0, let V be the set of ally e Y such that dr(Y,f(p)) &lt; e. 
Then Vis open; hencef-1(V) is open; hence there exists b &gt; 0 such that 
x ef-1(V)as soon as dx(P, x) &lt; b. But if x e 1-1(V), then f(x) e V, so 
that dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e. 
This completes the proof. 
Corollary A mapping f of a metric space X into a metric space Y is continuous if 
and only if f-1 ( C) is closed in X for every closed set C in Y. 
This follows from the theorem, since a set is closed if and only if its com&#173;
plement is open, and sincef-1(Ec) = [f-1(E)]c for every E c Y. 
We now turn to complex-valued and vector-valued functions, and to 
functions defined on subsets of Rk. 
4.9 Theorem Let f and g be complex continuous functions on a metric space X. 
Thenf + g,fg, andf /g are continuous on X. 
In the last case, we must of course assume that g(x) "I:-0, for all x e X. 
Proof At isolated points of X there is nothing to prove. At limit points, 
the statement follows from Theorems 4.4 and 4.6. 
4.10 Theorem 
(7) (a) Let /1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , .h be real functions on a metric space X, and let f be the 
mapping of X into Rk defined by 
f(x) = (Ji(x), ... ,/4(x)) (x EX); 
then f is continuous if and only if each of the functions Ji, ... , /2 is continuous. 
(b) If f and g are continuous mappings of X into Rk, then f + g and f &#183; g 
are continuous on X. 
The functions Ji, ... , /2 are called the components off. Note that 
f + g is a mapping into Rk, whereas f &#8226; g is a real function on X. 88 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Proof Part (a) follows from the inequalities 
k i 
11,(x) -f,(y) I =s; I f(x) -f(y) I = L lfi(x) -fi(y) I 2 ' 
t= 1 
for j = I, ... , k. Part (b) follows from (a) and Theorem 4.9. 
4.11 Examples If x1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , xk are the coordinates of the point x e Rk, the 
functions &lt;t,, defined by 
(8) 
are continuous on Rk, since the inequality 
I &lt;Pi(x) -&lt;Pi(Y) I :s; Ix -YI 
shows that we may take b = e in Definition 4.5. The functions &lt;Pt are sometimes 
called the coordinate functions. 
Repeated application of Theorem 4.9 then shows that every monomial 
(9) x:1~2 &#8226; , , x::k 
where n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , nk are nonnegative integers, is continuous on Rk. The same is 
true of constant multiples of (9), since constants are evidently continuous. It 
follows that every polynomial P, given by 
(10) 
is continuous on Rk. Here the coefficients cni&#183;&#183;&#8226;nk are complex numbers, n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , nk 
are nonnegative integers, and the sum in (IO) has finitely many terms. 
Furthermore, every rational function in x1, ... , xk, that is, every quotient 
of two polynomials of the form (10), is continuous on Rk wherever the denomi&#173;
nator is different from zero. 
From the triangle inequality one sees easily that 
(11) I Ix I -I YI I =s; Ix -YI (x, Y e Rk). 
Hence the mapping x ~ Ix I is a continuous real function on Rk. 
If now f is a continuous mapping from a metric space X into Rk, and if &lt;P 
is defined on Xby setting &lt;J,(p) = lf(p)I, it follows, by Theorem 4.7, that &lt;J, is a 
continuous real function on X. 
4.12 Remark We defined the notion of continuity for functions defined on a 
subset E of a metric space X. However, the complement of E in X plays no 
role whatever in this definition (note that the situation was somewhat different 
for limits of functions). Accordingly, we lose nothing of interest by discarding 
the complement of the domain off This means that we may just as well talk 
only about continuous mappings of one metric space into another, rather than CONTINUITY 89 
of mappings of subsets. This simplifies statements and proofs of some theorems. 
We have already made use of this principle in Theorems 4.8 to 4.10, and will 
continue to do so in the following section on compactness. 
CONTINUITY AND COMPACTNESS 
4.13 Definition A mapping f of a set E into Rk is said to be bounded if there is 
a real number M such that I f(x) I =s; M for all x e E. 
4.14 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space 
X into a metric space Y. Then f(X) is compact. 
Proof Let {VIZ} be an open cover off(X). Since/is continuous, Theorem 
4.8 shows that each of the sets /-1(VIZ) is open. Since X is compact, 
there are finitely many indices, say a1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , an, such that 
(12) X c/-1(VIZ1) u ... u 1-1(VIZn). 
(13) Since/(f-1(&#163;)) c E for every E c Y, (12) implies that 
/{X) C VIZ1 U ''' U VIZn, 
This completes the proof. 
Note: We have used the relation f(f-1(E)) c E, valid for E c Y. If 
E c X, then/-1(/(E)) =&gt; E; equality need not hold in either case. 
We shall now deduce some consequences of Theorem 4.14. 
4.15 Theorem If f is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space X into 
Rk, then f(X) is closed and bounded. Thus, f is bounded. 
This follows from Theorem 2.41. The result is particularly important 
when .f is real: 
4.16 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous real function on a compact metric 
space X, and 
(14) M = sup f(p), m = inf f(p). 
peX peX 
Then there exist points p, q e X such thatf(p) = M andf(q) = m. 
The notation in (14) means that Mis the least upper bound of the set of 
all numbersj(p), where p ranges over X, and that mis the greatest lower bound

The function concept and some of the related terminology were introduced in 
Definitions 2.1 and 2.2. Although we shall (in later chapters) be mainly interested 
in real and complex functions (i.e., in functions whose values are real or complex 
numbers) we shall also discuss vector-valued functions (i.e., functions with 
values in Rk) and functions with values in an arbitrary metric space. The theo&#173;
rems we shall discuss in this general setting would not become any easier if we 
restricted ourselves to real functions, for instance, and it actually simplifies and 
clarifies the picture to discard unnecessary hypotheses and to state and prove 
theorems in an appropriately general context. 
The domains of definition of our functions will also be metric spaces, 
suitably specialized in various instances. 
LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS 
4.1 Definition Let X and Y be metric spaces; suppose E c X, f maps E into 
Y, and p is a limit point of E. We write f(x) ~ q as x ~ p, or 
(1) lim/(x) = q 
x&#10132;p 84 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
if there is a point q e Y with the following property: For every e &gt; 0 there 
exists a o &gt; 0 such that 
(2) d1(f(x), q) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which 
(3) 0 &lt; dx(x,p) &lt; o. 
The symbols dx and dr refer to the distances in X and Y, respectively. 
If X and/ or Y are replaced by the real line, the complex plane, or by some 
euclidean space Rk, the distances dx, dr are of course replaced by absolute values, 
or by norms of differences ( see Sec. 2.16). 
It should be noted that p e X, but that p need not be a point of E 
in the above definition. Moreover, even if p e E, we may very well have 
f(p) f:. limx&#10132;pf(x). 
We can recast this definition in terms of limits of sequences: 
4.2 Theorem Let X, Y, E, f, and p be as in Definition 4. I. Then 
(4) limf(x) =q 
x&#10132;p 
if and only if 
(5) lim f(pn) =q 
n&#10132;oo 
for every sequence {Pn} in E such that 
(6) Pn f:. P, lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
Proof Suppose ( 4) holds. Choose {Pn} in E satisfying (6). Let e &gt; 0 
be given. Then there exists o &gt; 0 such that dr(f(x), q) &lt; e if x e E 
and O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Also, there exists N such that n &gt; N implies 
0 &lt; dx(Pn ,p) &lt; o. Thus, for n &gt; N, we have dy(f(pn), q) &lt; e, which 
shows that (5) holds. 
Conversely, suppose ( 4) is false. Then there exists some e &gt; 0 such 
that for every o &gt; 0 there exists a point x e E (depending on o), for which 
dr(f(x), q) :2:: e but O &lt; dx(x, p) &lt; o. Taking on = I/n (n = I, 2, 3, ... ), we 
thus find a sequence in E satisfying (6) for which (5) is false. 
Corollary If f has a limit at p, this limit is unique. 
This follows from Theorems 3.2(b) and 4.2. CONTINUITY 85 
4.3 Definition Suppose we have two complex functions,/ and g, both defined 
on E. By f + g we mean the function which assigns to each point x of E the 
number f(x) + g(x). Similarly we define the difference f -g, the product fg, 
and the quotientf/g of the two functions, with the understanding that the quo&#173;
tient is defined only at those points x of E at which g(x) "I:-0. If f assigns to each 
point x of E the same number c, then f is said to be a constant function, or 
simply a constant, and we write f = c. If f and g are real functions, and if 
f(x) ~ g(x) for every x e E, we shall sometimes write f ~ g, for brevity. 
Similarly, if f and g map E into Rk, we define f + g and f &#183; g by 
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), (f &#183; g)(x) = f(x) &#8226; g(x); 
and if). is a real number, (lf)(x) = ).f(x). 
4.4 Theorem Suppose E c X, a metric space, p is a limit point of E, f and g 
are complex functions on E, and 
lim f(x) = A, lim g(x) = B. 
x&#10132;p 
Tl1en (a) lim (f + g)(x) = A + B; 
x&#10132;p 
(b) lim (fg)(x) = AB; 
x&#10132;p 
(c) lim [_ (x) = ~, if B "I:-0. 
x&#10132;p g B 
Proof In view of Theorem 4.2, these assertions follow immediately from 
the analogous properties of sequences (Theorem 3.3). 
Remark If f and g map E into Rk, then (a) remains true, and (b) becomes 
(b') lim (f &#183; g)(x) = A &#183; B. 
(Compare Theorem 3.4.) 
CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS 
4.S Definition Suppose X and Y are metric spaces, E c X, p e E, and f maps 
E into Y. Then f is said to be continuous at p if for every e &gt; 0 there exists a 
c5 &gt; 0 such that 
dr(f(x),f(p)) &lt; e 
for all points x e E for which dx(x, p) &lt; b. 
If f is continuous at every point of E, then f is said to be continuous on E. 
It should be noted that f has to be defined at the point p in order to be 
continuous at p. (Compare this with the remark following Definition 4.1.) </description></item><item><title>4 Discontinuities</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/4_Discontinuities.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY 93 
4.21 Example Let X be the half-open interval [O, 2n) on the real line, and 
let f be the mapping of X onto the circle Y consisting of all points whose distance 
from the origin is 1, given by 
(24) f(t) = (cost, sin t) (0 ~ t &lt; 2n). 
The continuity of the trigonometric functions cosine and sine, as well as their 
periodicity properties, will be established in Chap. 8. These results show that 
f is a continuous 1-1 mapping of X onto Y. 
However, the inverse mapping (which exists, since f is one-to-one and 
onto) fails to be continuous at the point (1, 0) = f(O). Of course, X is not com&#173;
pact in this example. (It may be of interest to observe that r-1 fails to be 
continuous in spite of the fact that Y is compact!) 
CONTINUITY AND CONNECTEDNESS 
4.22 Theorem If f is a continuous mapping of a metric space X into a metric 
space Y, and if E is a connected subset of X, then f(E) is connected. 
Proof Assume, on the contrary, that/(&#163;)= Au B, where A and Bare 
nonempty separated subsets of Y. Put G =En f-1(A), H =En f-1(B). 
Then E =Gu H, and neither G nor His empty. 
Since Ac A (the closure of A), we have G c/-1(.A); the latter set is 
closed, since/is continuous; hence G c/-1(.A). It follows that/(G) c .A. 
Since f(H) =Band An Bis empty, we conclude that G n His empty. 
The same argument shows that G n His empty. Thus G and Hare 
separated. This is impossible if E is connected. 
4.23 Theorem Let f be a continuous real function on the interval [a, b ]. If 
f(a) &lt;f(b) and if c is a number such that f(a) &lt; c &lt;f(b), then there exists a 
point x e (a, b) such that f(x) = c. 
A similar result holds, of course, if /(a) &gt; f(b). Roughly speaking, the 
theorem says that a continuous real function assumes all intermediate values on 
an interval. 
Proof By Theorem 2.47, [a, b] is connected; hence Theorem 4.22 shows 
that f([a, b ]) is a connected subset of R1, and the assertion follows if we 
appeal once more to Theorem 2.47. 
4.24 Remark At first glance, it might seem that Theorem 4.23 has a converse. 
That is, one might think that if for any two points x1 &lt; x2 and for any number c 
between/(x 1) and/(x 2) there is a point x in (x1, x2) such that/(x) = c, then/ 
must be continuous. 
That this is not so may be concluded from Example 4.27(d). 94 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
DISCONTINUITIES 
If x is a point in the domain of definition of the function f at which f is not 
continuous, we say that/is discontinuous at x, or that/ has a discontinuity at x. 
If f is defined on an interval or on a segment, it is customary to divide discon&#173;
tinuities into two types. Before giving this classification, we have to define the 
right-hand and the left-hand limits offatx, which we denote by/(x+) and/(x-), 
respectively. 
4.25 Definition Let/ be defined on (a, b). Consider any point x such that 
a ~ x &lt; b. We write 
f(x+) =q 
if f(tn) ) q as n ) oo, for all sequences {tn} in (x, b) such that tn ) x. To obtain 
the definition off (x -), for a &lt; x ~ b, we restrict ourselves to sequences { tn} in 
(a, x). 
It is clear that any point x of (a, b), limf(t) exists if and only if 
t&#10132;x 
f(x+) = f(x-) = lim/(t). 
t&#10132;x 
4.26 Definition Let f be defined on (a, b). If f is discontinuous at a point x, 
and if f(x +) and f (x-) exist, then./ is said to have a discontinuity of the first 
kind, or a simple discontinuity, at x. Otherwise the discontinuity is said to be of 
the second kind. 
There are two ways in which a function can have a simple discontinuity: 
either f(x+) =/:, f(x-) [in which case the value /(x) is immaterial], or f(x +) = 
f (x - ) =/:-f(x). 
4.27 Examples 
(a) Define 
l f(x) = 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). 
Then/has a discontinuity of the second kind at every point x. since 
neither f (x +) nor/ (x-) exists. 
(b) Define 
/(x) = X 0 (x rational), 
(x irrational). </description></item><item><title>0 Limits of Functions</title><num_pages>1</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/0_Limits_of_Functions.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY

LIMITS OF FUNCTIONS 
4.1 Definition Let X and Y be metric spaces; suppose E c X, f maps E into 
Y, and p is a limit point of E. We write f(x) ~ q as x ~ p, or 
(1) lim/(x) = q 
x&#10132;p </description></item><item><title>3 Continuity and Connectedness</title><num_pages>5</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap4/3_Continuity_and_Connectedness.pdf</link><description>CONTINUITY 89 
of mappings of subsets. This simplifies statements and proofs of some theorems. 
We have already made use of this principle in Theorems 4.8 to 4.10, and will 
continue to do so in the following section on compactness. 
CONTINUITY AND COMPACTNESS 
4.13 Definition A mapping f of a set E into Rk is said to be bounded if there is 
a real number M such that I f(x) I =s; M for all x e E. 
4.14 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space 
X into a metric space Y. Then f(X) is compact. 
Proof Let {VIZ} be an open cover off(X). Since/is continuous, Theorem 
4.8 shows that each of the sets /-1(VIZ) is open. Since X is compact, 
there are finitely many indices, say a1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , an, such that 
(12) X c/-1(VIZ1) u ... u 1-1(VIZn). 
(13) Since/(f-1(&#163;)) c E for every E c Y, (12) implies that 
/{X) C VIZ1 U ''' U VIZn, 
This completes the proof. 
Note: We have used the relation f(f-1(E)) c E, valid for E c Y. If 
E c X, then/-1(/(E)) =&gt; E; equality need not hold in either case. 
We shall now deduce some consequences of Theorem 4.14. 
4.15 Theorem If f is a continuous mapping of a compact metric space X into 
Rk, then f(X) is closed and bounded. Thus, f is bounded. 
This follows from Theorem 2.41. The result is particularly important 
when .f is real: 
4.16 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous real function on a compact metric 
space X, and 
(14) M = sup f(p), m = inf f(p). 
peX peX 
Then there exist points p, q e X such thatf(p) = M andf(q) = m. 
The notation in (14) means that Mis the least upper bound of the set of 
all numbersj(p), where p ranges over X, and that mis the greatest lower bound 
of tl1is set of numbers. 90 PllINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
The conclusion may also be stated as follows: There exist points p and q 
in X such that f(q) ~f(x) ~f(p) for all x e X; that is, f attains its maximum 
(at p) and its minimum (at q). 
Proof By Theorem 4.15, f ( X) is a closed and bounded set of real num&#173;
bers; hence/ (X) contains 
M = supf(X) 
by Theorem 2.28. and m = inff(X), 
4.17 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous 1-1 mapping of a compact metric 
space X onto a metric space Y. Then the inverse mapping 1-1 defined on Y by 
(xe X) 
is a continuous mapping of Y onto X. 
Proof Applying Theorem 4.8 to .r-1 in place of/, we see that it suffices 
to prove that/(V) is an open set in Y for every open set Vin X. Fix such 
a set V. 
The complement V c of V is closed in X, hence compact (Theorem 
2.35); hence f(Vc) is a compact subset of Y (Theorem 4.14) and so is 
closed in Y (Theorem 2. 34). Since .f is one-to-one and onto, f ( V) is the 
complement off ( V c). Hence f ( V) is open. 
4.18 Definition Let/be a mapping of a metric space X into a metric space Y. 
We say that/ is uniformly continuous on X if for every e &gt; 0 there exists{)&gt; 0 
such that 
(15) dy(f(p),f(q)) &lt; B 
for all p and q in X for which dx(P, q) &lt; b. 
Let us consider the differences between the concepts of continuity and of 
uniform continuity. First, uniform continuity is a property of a function on a 
set, whereas continuity can be defined at a single point. To ask whether a given 
function is uniformly continuous at a certain point is meaningless. Second, if 
f is continuous on X, then it is possible to find, for each e &gt; 0 and for each 
point p of X, a number b &gt; 0 having the property specified in Definition 4.5. This 
b depends one and on p. If f is, however, uniformly continuous on X, then it is 
possible, for each e &gt; 0, to find one number {) &gt; 0 which will do for all points 
p of X. 
Evidently, every uniformly continuous function is continuous. That the 
two concepts are equivalent on compact sets follows from the next theorem. CONTINUITY 91 
4.19 Theorem Let f be a continuous mapping of a compact metric space X 
into a metric space Y. Then f is uniformly continuous on X. 
(16) 
(17) 
(18) 
(19) 
(20) Proof Let e &gt; 0 be given. Since f is continuous, we can associate to 
each point p e X a positive number &lt;J,(p) such that 
q e X, dx(P, q) &lt; &lt;J,(p) implies B dr(f(p), f(q)) &lt; 2&#183; 
Let J(p) be the set of all q e X for which 
dx(P, q) &lt; &#189;&lt;J&gt;(p). 
Since p e J(p), the collection of all sets J(p) is an open cover of X; and 
since Xis compact, there is a finite set of points p1, .&#8226;&#8226; , Pn in X, such that 
X C J(p1) U &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; U J(pn). 
We put 
b = &#189; min [&lt;P(P1), &#8226;.. , &lt;P(Pn)]. 
Then b &gt; 0. (This is one point where the finiteness of the covering, in&#173;
herent in the definition of compactness, is essential. The minimum of a 
finite set of positive numbers is positive, whereas the inf of an infinite set 
of positive numbers may very well be 0.) 
Now let q and p be points of X, such that dx(P, q) &lt; b. By (18), there 
is an integer m, 1 ~ m ~ n, such that p e J (Pm); hence 
and we also have 
dx(q, Pm) ~ dx(P, q) + dx(P, Pm) &lt; b + &#189;&lt;/&gt;(Pm) =s; &lt;J&gt;(pm). 
Finally, (16) shows that therefore 
dy(f(p),f(q)) =s; dy(f(p),f(Pm)) + dy(f(q),f(Pm)) &lt; B. 
This completes the proof. 
An alternative proof is sketched in Exercise 10. 
We now proceed to show that compactness is essential in the hypotheses 
of Theorems 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, and 4.19. 
4.20 Theorem Let E be a noncompact set in R1&#8226; Then 
(a) there exists a continuous function on E which is not bounded,&#183; 
(b) there exists a continuous and bounded function on E which has no 
&#8226; maxzmum. 
If, in addition, E is bounded, then 92 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(21) 
(22) 
(23) (c) there exists a continuous function on E which is not uniformly 
&#8226; continuous. 
Proof Suppose first that E is bounded, so that there exists a limit point 
x0 of E which is not a point of E. Consider 
1 f(x)=--x-x0 (x e E). 
This is continuous on E (Theorem 4.9), but evidently unbounded. To see 
that (21) is not uniformly continuous, let e &gt; 0 and~&gt; 0 be arbitrary, and 
choose a point x e E such that Ix -x0 I &lt; ~-Taking t close enough to 
x0, we can then make the difference lf(t) -f(x) I greater than e, although 
It -xi &lt; ~-Since this is true for every~&gt; O,f is not uniformly continu&#173;
ous on E. 
The function g given by 
l 
g(x) = 1 + (x -x0)2 (xeE) 
is continuous on E, and is bounded, since O &lt; g(x) &lt; 1. It is clear that 
sup g(x) = 1, 
xeE 
whereas g(x) &lt; l for all x e E. Thus g has no maximum on E. 
Having proved the theorem for bounded sets E, let us now suppose 
that E is unbounded. Then f(x) = x establishes (a), whereas 
x2 
h(x) = I 2 +x (xeE) 
establishes (b), since 
sup h(x) = 1 
xeE 
and h(x) &lt; 1 for all x e E. 
Assertion (c) would be false if boundedness were omitted from the 
hypotheses. For, let E be the set of all integers. Then every function 
defined on E is uniformly continuous on E. To see this, we need merely 
take~&lt; 1 in Definition 4.18. 
We conclude this section by showing that compactness is also essential in 
Theorem 4.17. CONTINUITY 93 
4.21 Example Let X be the half-open interval [O, 2n) on the real line, and 
let f be the mapping of X onto the circle Y consisting of all points whose distance 
from the origin is 1, given by 
(24) f(t) = (cost, sin t) (0 ~ t &lt; 2n). 
The continuity of the trigonometric functions cosine and sine, as well as their 
periodicity properties, will be established in Chap. 8. These results show that 
f is a continuous 1-1 mapping of X onto Y. 
However, the inverse mapping (which exists, since f is one-to-one and 
onto) fails to be continuous at the point (1, 0) = f(O). Of course, X is not com&#173;

continuous in spite of the fact that Y is compact!)

4.23 Theorem Let f be a continuous real function on the interval [a, b ]. If 
f(a) &lt;f(b) and if c is a number such that f(a) &lt; c &lt;f(b), then there exists a

that f([a, b ]) is a connected subset of R1, and the assertion follows if we
