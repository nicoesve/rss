24. The process described in part (c) of Exercise 22 can of course also be applied to 
functions that map (O, oo) to (0, oo ). 
Fix some oc &gt; 1, and put 
1 oc f(x) = 2 X +-x' oc + X 
g(x) = 1 + x&#183; 
Both f and g have v; as their only fixed point in (O, oo ). Try to explain, on the 
basis of properties off and g, why the convergence in Exercise 16, Chap. 3, is so 
much more rapid than it is in Exercise 17. (Compare/' and g ', draw the zig-zags 
suggested in Exercise 22.) 
Do the same when O &lt; oc &lt; 1. 
25. Suppose f is twice differentiable on [a, b], f(a) &lt; 0, f(b) &gt; 0, f'(x) ~ 8 &gt; 0, and 
0 ~f''(x) ~ M for all x E [a, b]. Let g be the unique point in (a, b) at which 
f(f) = 0. 
Complete the details in the following outline of Newton's method for com&#173;
puting f. 
(a) Choose X1 E (f, b), and define {xn} by 
f(xn) 
Xn+l = Xn -f'(Xn) &#8226; 
Interpret this geometrically, in terms of a tangent to the graph off. 
(b) Prove that Xn+l &lt; Xn and that 
lim Xn = g, 
n-o oo 
(c) Use Taylor's theorem to show that 
f''(tn) 2 
Xn+l -f = 2/'(Xn) (Xn -f) 
for some tn E (f, Xn), 
(d) If A= M/28, deduce that 
0 ~ Xn+l -f ~ 1 [A(X1 -f)]2n. 
(Compare with Exercises 16 and 18, Chap. 3.) 
(e) Show that Newton's method amounts to finding a fixed point of the function 
g defined by 
f(x) 
g(x) = x -f'(x) . 
How does g '(x) behave for x near f?

26. Suppose/ is differentiable on [a, b], f(a) = 0, and there is a real number A such 
that lf'(x) I s A lf(x) I on [a, b]. Prove that f(x) = 0 for all x E [a, b]. Hint: Fix 
Xo E [a, b], let 
Mo= sup! f(x)I, M1 = sup IJ'(x) I 
for as x s Xo. For any such x, 
lf(x) I s M1(Xo -a) s A(xo -a)Mo. 
Hence Mo = 0 if A(xo -a) &lt; 1. That is,/= 0 on [a, Xo], Proceed. 
27. Let&lt;/&gt; be a real function defined on a rectangle R in the plane, given by as x s b, 
ex sy &lt; {3. A solution of the initial-value problem 
y' = cp(x, y), y(a) = c (ex s cs /3) 
is, by definition, a differentiable function/ on [a, b] such that/(a) = c, ex s/(x) s /3, 
and 
f'(x) = cp(x, f(x)) (a&lt;xsb). 
Prove that such a problem has at most one solution if there is a constant A such 
that 
I &lt;/&gt;(x, Y2) -cp(x, Y1) I s A I Y2 -Y1 I 
whenever (x, Y1) ER and (x, Y2) E R. 
Hint: Apply Exercise 26 to the difference of two solutions. Note that this 
uniqueness theorem does not hold for the initial-value problem 
y' = yl/2, y(O) = 0, 
which has two solutions: f(x) = 0 and/(x) = x2/4. Find all other solutions. 
28. Formulate and prove an analogous uniqueness theorem for systems of differential 
equations of the form 
Y.1 = &lt;/&gt;1(X, Y1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Yk), 
Note that this can be rewritten in the form 
y' = &lt;l&gt;(x, y), (j = 1, ... , k). 
y(a) = C 
where y = (Y1, ... , yk) ranges over a k-cell, &lt;I&gt; is the mapping of a (k + 1)-cell 
into the Euclidean k-space whose components are the functions c/&gt;1, ... , &lt;pk, and c 
is the vector (c1, ... , ck), Use Exercise 26, for vector-valued functions. 
29. Specialize Exercise 28 by considering the system

subject to initial conditions 
y(a) = C1, y'(a) = C2, . . . ' THE RIEMANN-STIELTJES INTEGRAL 
The present chapter is based on a definition of the Riemann integral which 
depends very explicitly on the order structure of the real line. Accordingly, 
we begin by discussing integration of real-valued functions on intervals. Ex&#173;
tensions to complex- and vector-valued functions on intervals follow in later 
sections. Integration over sets other than intervals is discussed in Chaps. 10 
and 11. 
DEFINITION AND EXISTENCE OF THE INTEGRAL 
6.1 Definition Let [a, b] be a given interval. By a partition P of [a, b] we 
mean a finite set of points x0, x1, &#8226;.&#8226; , Xn, where 
We write 
Ax,= x, -x,-1 (i=1, ... ,n). THE RIEMANN&#183;STIELTJES INTEGRAL 121 
Now suppose f is a bounded real function defined on [a, b ]. Corresponding to 
each partition P of [a, b] we put 
and finally 
(1) 
(2) M1 = supf(x) 
m, = inff(x) 
n 
U(P,f) = L M, Ax,' 
i= 1 
n 
L(P,f) = L m1 dx1, 
i= 1 
-b (X,-1 S XS X1), 
(Xi-1 S XS X1), 
f dx = inf U(P,f), 
a 
b 
f dx = sup L(P,f), 
_a 
where the inf and the sup are taken over all partitions P of [a, b]. The left 
members of (1) and (2) are called the upper and lower Riemann integrals off 
over [a, b], respectively. , 
If the upper and lower integrals are equal, we say that f is Riemann&#173;
integrable on [a, b], we write f E f!A (that, is, f!A denotes the set of Riemann&#173;
integrable functions), and we denote the common value of (1) and (2) by 
b 
(3) fdx, 
a 
or by 
b 
(4) f(x) dx. 
a 
This is the Riemann integral off over [a, b]. Since f is bounded, there 
exist two numbers, m and M, such that 
msf(x)sM (as x s b). 
Hence, for every P, 
m(b -a) s L(P,f) s U(P,f) s M(b -a), 
so that the numbers L(P,f) and U(P,f) form a bounded set. This shows that 
the upper and lower integrals are defined for every bounded function f The 
question of their equality, and hence the question of the integrability off, is a 
more delicate one. Instead of investigating it separately for the Riemann integral, 
we shall immediately consider a more general situation. 122 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
6.2 Definition Let ~ be a monotonically increasing function on [a, b] (since 
~(a) and ~(b) are finite, it follows that~ is bounded on [a, b]). Corresponding to 
each partition P of [a, b ], we write 
Li~t = ~(X1) -~(X1-1), 
It is clear that a~,~ 0. For any real function f which is bounded on [a, b] 
we put 
n 
u(P,f, ~) = I M1 a~,, 
I= 1 
n 
L(P,f, ~) = L m, a~i' 
i= 1 
where M1, m1 have the same meaning as in Definition 6.1, and we define 
-b 
(5) f d~ = inf U(P,f, ~), 
a 
b 
(6) f d~ = sup L(P,f, ~), 
_a 
the inf and sup again being taken over all partitions. 
If the left members of (5) and (6) are equal, we denote their common 
value by 
b 
(7) fd~ 
a 
or sometimes by 
(8) 
a 
This is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral ( or simply the Stieltjes integral) of 
/with respect to~, over [a, b]. 
If (7) exists, i.e., if (5) and (6) are equal, we say that f is integrable with 
respect to ~, in the Riemann sense, and write f e Bl(~). 
By taking ~(x) = x, the Riemann integral is seen to be a special case of 
the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. Let us mention explicitly, however, that in the 
general case ~ need not even be continuous. 
A few words should be said about the notation. We prefer (7) to (8), since 
the letter x which appears in (8) adds nothing to the content of (7). It is im&#173;
material which letter we use to represent the so-called ''variable of integration." 
For instance, (8) is the same as 
a THE IUEMANN&#8226;STIELTJES INTEGRAL 123 
The integral depends on f, ix, a and b, but not on the variable of integration, 
which may as well be omitted. 
The role played by the variable of integration is quite analogous to that 
of the index of summation: The two symbols 
mean the same thing~ since each means c1 + c2 + &#183; &#183; &#183; +en. 
Of course, no harm is done by inserting the variable of integration, and 
in many cases it is actually convenient to do so. 
We shall now investigate the existence of the integral (7). Without saying 
so every time,fwill be assumed real and bounded, and ix monotonically increas-
ing on [a, b]; and, when there can be no misunderstanding, we shall write in 
b 
place of .

6.3 Definition We say that the partition P* is a refinenzent of P if P* =:, P 
( that is, if every point of P is a point of P *). Given two partitions, P 1 and P 2 , 
we say that P* is their common refinement if P* = P1 u P2. 
6.4 Theorem If P* is a refinement of P, then 
(9) 
and 
(10) L(P,f, ix)~ L(P*,f, ix) 
U(P*,f, ix)~ U(P,f, ix). 
Proof To prove (9), suppose first that P* contains just one point more 
than P. Let this extra point be x&#8226;, and suppose xi-l &lt; x&#8226; &lt; x1, where 
xi-l and x, are two consecutive points of P. Put 
w1 = inff(x) 
W2 = inff(x) (xi-i ~ x ~ x*), 
(x&#8226; ~ x ~ x1). 
Clearly w1 ~ mi and w2 ~ mi, where, as before, 
mi= inff(x) 
Hence 
L(P*,f, ix) -L(P,f, ix) 
= w1[ix(x*) -ix(xi_1)] + w2[oc(xi) -ix{x*)] -mi[ix(xi) -ix(x,_1)] 
= (w1 -m1)[oc(x*) -ix(x,_1)] + (w2 -mi)[ix(x1) -ix(x*)] ~ 0. 
If P&#8226; contains k points more than P, we repeat this reasoning k 
times, and arrive at (9). The proof of (10) is analogous. </description></item><item><title>3 Integration of Vector-valued Functions</title><num_pages>3</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap6/3_Integration_of_Vector-valued_Functions.pdf</link><description>THE IUEMANN&#8226;STIELTJES INTEGRAL 123

6.3 Definition We say that the partition P* is a refinenzent of P if P* =:, P 
( that is, if every point of P is a point of P *). Given two partitions, P 1 and P 2 , 
we say that P* is their common refinement if P* = P1 u P2. 
6.4 Theorem If P* is a refinement of P, then 
(9)

(10) L(P,f, ix)~ L(P*,f, ix) 
U(P*,f, ix)~ U(P,f, ix).

xi-l and x, are two consecutive points of P. Put 
w1 = inff(x) 
W2 = inff(x) (xi-i ~ x ~ x*), 
(x&#8226; ~ x ~ x1). 
Clearly w1 ~ mi and w2 ~ mi, where, as before, 
mi= inff(x) 
Hence 
L(P*,f, ix) -L(P,f, ix) 
= w1[ix(x*) -ix(xi_1)] + w2[oc(xi) -ix{x*)] -mi[ix(xi) -ix(x,_1)] 
= (w1 -m1)[oc(x*) -ix(x,_1)] + (w2 -mi)[ix(x1) -ix(x*)] ~ 0. 
If P&#8226; contains k points more than P, we repeat this reasoning k 
times, and arrive at (9). The proof of (10) is analogous. 124 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

6.S Theorem f da. ~ f da.. 
(11) 
(12) _a a 
Proof Let P* be the common refinement of two partitions P 1 and P 2 &#8226; 
By Theorem 6.4, 
L(P1,f, a.)~ L(P*,f. a.)~ U(P*,f, a.)~ U(P2 ,f, a.). 
Hence 
If P2 is fixed and the sup is taken over all P1, (11) gives 
f da. ~ U(P2 ,f, a.). 
-
The theorem follows by taking the inf over all P2 in (12). 
6.6 Theorem f e af(a.) on [a, b] if and only if for every 8 &gt; 0 there exists a 
partition P such that 
(13) 
(14) 
(15) U(P,f, a.) -L(P,f, a.) &lt; 8. 
Proof For every P we have 
-
L(P,f, a.)~ f da. ~ f da. ~ U(P,f, a.). -
Thus (13) implies 
-
0 ~ f da. -f da. &lt; 8. -
Hence, if (13) can be satisfied for every 8 &gt; 0, we have 
-
f da. = f da., -
that is, f e af(a.). 
Conversely, suppose f e af(a.), and let e &gt; 0 be given. Then there 
exist partitions P1 and P2 such that THE RIEMANN&#183;STIELTJES INTEGRAL 12S 
We choose P to be the common refinement of P1 and P2&#8226; Then Theorem 
6.4, together with (14) and (15), shows that 
B U(P,f, oc) ~ U(P2 ,f, oc) &lt; f doc + 2 &lt; L(P1,f, oc) + e ~ L(P,f, oc) + e, 
so that (13) holds for this partition P. 
Theorem 6.6 furnishes a convenient criterion for integrability. Before we 
apply it, we state some closely related facts. 
6.7 Theorem 
(a) I/(13) holds for some P and some e, then (13) holds (with the same e) 
for every refinement of P. 
(b) If (13) holds for P = {x0, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , xn} and if si, ti are arbitrary points in 
[xi-i, xi], then

i= 1 
(c) If fe al(oc) and the hypotheses of(b) hold, then 
n b 
L f(t i) Lioci -f doc &lt; e. 
i= 1 a 
Proof Theorem 6.4 implies (a). Under the assumptions made in (b), 
both/(si) andf(ti) lie in [mi, Mi], so that f(si) -f(t,)I ~ M, -mi. Thus 
n I lf(s,) -f(t ,) I Lioci ~ U(P,f, oc) -L(P,f, oc), 
i= 1 
which proves (b). The obvious inequalities 
L(P,f, oc) ~ Lf(ti) Lioci ~ U(P,f,oc) 
and 
L(P,f, oc) ~ J f doc~ U(P,f, oc) 
prove (c). 
6.8 Theorem If f is continuous on [a, b] thenfe al(oc) on [a, b]. 
(16) Proof Let e &gt; 0 be given. Choose 17 &gt; 0 so that 
[oc(b) -oc(a)]17 &lt; e. 
Since f is uniformly continuous on [a, b] (Theorem 4.19), there exists a 
J &gt; 0 such that

(22) Next, suppose (15) holds. Keeping y fixed in (18), we can choose 
a point c1 e (a, y) such that g(x) &gt; g(y) and g(x) &gt; 0 if a&lt; x &lt; c1. Multi&#173;

In the same manner, if -oo &lt; A ~ + oo, and p is chosen so that 
p &lt; A, we can find a point c3 such that

Then there exists a point x between IX and /3 such that 
(24) n. 
For n = 1, this is just the mean value theorem. In general, the theorem 
shows that f can be approximated by a polynomial of degree n -1, and that 
(24) allows us to estimate the error, if we know bounds on lf&lt;n&gt;(x) I&#8226; 
(25) 
(26) 
(27) Proof Let M be the number defined by 
f(/3) = P(/3) + M(/3 -1X)n 
and put 
g(t) =f(t) -P(t) -M(t -1X)n (a~ t ~ b). 
We have to show that n !M = f&lt;n&gt;(x) for some x between IX and /3. By 
(23) and (26), 
(a&lt; t &lt; b). 
Hence the proof will be complete if we can show that g&lt;n&gt;(x) = 0 for some 
x between IX and f3. 
Since p&lt;k&gt;(IX) = [&lt;k&gt;(IX) fork= 0, ... , n -1, we have 
(28) g(IX) = g'(IX) = ''' = g&lt;n-l)(IX) = 0. 
Our choice of M shows that g(/3) = 0, so that g'(x1) = 0 for some x1 
between IX and /3, by the mean value theorem. Since g1(1X) = 0, we conclude 
similarly that g''(x2) = 0 for some x2 between IX and x1. After n steps we 
arrive at the conclusion that g&lt;n&gt;(xn) = 0 for some Xn bet ween IX and Xn _ 1, 
that is, between IX and /3. 
DIFFERENTIATION OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS 
5.16 Remarks Definition 5.1 applies without any change to complex functions 
f defined on [a, b], and Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, as well as their proofs, remain 
valid. If /1 and/2 are the real and imaginary parts of I, that is, if 
f(t) = li(t) + if2(t) 
for a~ t ~ b, where/ 1(t) and/2(t) are real, then we clearly have 
(29) f'(x) = f{(x) + ifi(x); 
also, f is differentiable at x if and only if both /1 and /2 are differentiable at x. 112 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Passing to vector-valued functions in general, i.e., to functions f which 
map [a, b] into some Rk, we may still apply Definition 5.1 to define f'(x). The 
term &lt;p(t) in (1) is now, for each t, a point in Rk, and the limit in (2) is taken with 
respect to the norm of Rk. In other words, f'(x) is that point of Rk (if there is 
one) for which 
(30) lim f(t) -f(x) -f'(x) = 0, 
t&#10132;x t -X 
and f' is again a function with values in Rk. 
If /1, &#8226;.. , fk are the components off, as defined in Theorem 4.10, then 
(31) f' = (/{, ... ,/;), 
and f is differentiable at a point x if and only if each of the functions /1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , h 
is differentiable at x. 
Theorem 5.2 is true in this context as well, and so is Theorem 5.3(a) and 
{b), if Jg is replaced by the inner product f &#183; g (see Definition 4.3). 
When we turn to the mean value theorem, however, and to one of its 
consequences, namely, L'Hospital's rule, the situation changes. The next two 
examples will show that each of these. results fails to be true for complex-valued 
functions. 
5.17 Example Define, for real x, 
(32) f(x) = eix = cos x + i sin x. 
{The last expression may be taken as the definition of the complex exponential 
eix; see Chap. 8 for a full discussion of these functions.) Then 
(33) 
but 
(34) f(2n) -/(0) = 1 - 1 = 0, 
f'(x) = ieix, 
so that 1/'(x) I = 1 for all real x. 
Thus Theorem 5.10 fails to hold in this case. 
5.18 Example On the segment (0, 1), define/(x) = x and 
(35) g(x) = x + x2eilx2
&#8226; 
Since I eit I = 1 for all real t, we see that 
(36) lim f(x) = 1. 
x&#10132;O g(x) Next, 
(37) 
so that 
(38) 
Hence 
(39) 
and so 
(40) g'(x) = 1 + 2 2i i/x2 x--e 
X (0 &lt; X &lt; 1), 
lu'(x) I ~ 2i 2x-&#173;x 2 -1~--1. 
X 
/'(x) 1 X =--~--g'(x) lu'(x) I 2 -x 
lim f'(x) = 0. 
x&#10132;o g'(x) DIFFERENTIATION 113 
By (36) and ( 40), L'Hospital's rule fails in this case. Note also that g'(x) &#165;: 0 
on (0, 1 ), by (38). 
However, there is a consequence of the mean value theorem which, for 
purposes of applications, is almost as useful as Theorem 5.10, and which re&#173;
mains true for vector-valued functions: From Theorem 5.10 it follows that 
(41) IJ(b) -f(a) I ~ (b -a) sup 1/'(x) 1-
a&lt;x&lt;b 
5.19 Theorem Suppose f is a continuous mapping of [a, b] into Rk and f is 
differentiable in (a, b). Then there exists x E (a, b) such that 
jf(b) -f(a)I ~ (b -a)lf'(x)I. 
Proof1 Putz = f(b) -f(a), and define 
&lt;p( t ) = z &#8226; f( t) ( a ~ t ~ b). 
Then &lt;p is a real-valued continuous function on [a, b] which is differentia&#173;
ble in (a, b). The mean value theorem shows therefore that 
&lt;p(b) -&lt;p(a) = (b -a)&lt;p'(x) = (b &#183;-a)z &#183; f'(x) 
for some x E (a, b). On the other hand, 
&lt;p( b) -&lt;p( a) = z &#183; f( b) -z &#183; f( a) = z &#183; z = I z I 2&#8226; 
The Schwarz inequality now gives 
I z I 2 = ( b -a) I z &#183; f' ( x) I ~ ( b -a) I z I I f' ( x) I . 
Hence lzl ~ (b -a)lf'(x)I, which is the desired conclusion.

20. Formulate and prove an inequality which follows from Taylor's theorem and 
which remains valid for vector-valued functions. 
21. Let E be a closed subset of Ri. We saw in Exercise 22, Chap. 4, that there is a 
real continuous function/ on Ri whose zero set is E. Is it possible, for each closed 
set E, to find such an / which is differentiable on Ri, or one which is n times 
differentiable, or even one which has derivatives of all orders on Ri? 
22. Suppose f is a real function on ( -oo, oo ). Call x a fixed point off if f(x) = x. 
(a) If /is differentiable and/'(t) cf=. 1 for every real t, prove that/has at most one 
fixed point. 
(b) Show that the function/ defined by 
J(t) = t + (1 + er)-i 
has no fixed point, although O &lt;/'(t) &lt; 1 for all real t. 
(c) However, if there is a constant A &lt; 1 such that 1/'(t) I ~ A for all real t, prove 
that a fixed point x of/ exists, and that x = lim Xn, where Xi is an arbitrary real 
number and 
Xn+1 =f(Xn) 
for n = 1, 2, 3, .... 
(d) Show that the process described in (c) can be visualized by the zig-zag path 
23. The function f defined by 
f(x) = x3 + 1

has three fixed points, say IX, {J, y, where 
-2&lt;1X&lt;-l ' 0 &lt; fJ &lt; 1, 1 &lt; y &lt; 2. 
For arbitrarily chosen Xi, define {xn} by setting Xn + i = f(xn), 
(a) If Xi &lt; IX, prove that Xn &#9658; -oo as n &#9658; oo. 
(b) If IX&lt; Xi&lt; y, prove that Xn &#9658; fJ as n &#9658; oo. 
(c) If y &lt; Xi, prove that Xn &#9658; + oo as n &#9658; oo. 
Thus fJ can be located by this method, but IX and y cannot. 118 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
24. The process described in part (c) of Exercise 22 can of course also be applied to 
functions that map (O, oo) to (0, oo ). 
Fix some oc &gt; 1, and put

g(x) = 1 + x&#183; 
Both f and g have v; as their only fixed point in (O, oo ). Try to explain, on the 
basis of properties off and g, why the convergence in Exercise 16, Chap. 3, is so 
much more rapid than it is in Exercise 17. (Compare/' and g ', draw the zig-zags 
suggested in Exercise 22.) 
Do the same when O &lt; oc &lt; 1. 
25. Suppose f is twice differentiable on [a, b], f(a) &lt; 0, f(b) &gt; 0, f'(x) ~ 8 &gt; 0, and 
0 ~f''(x) ~ M for all x E [a, b]. Let g be the unique point in (a, b) at which

Proof Let e &gt; 0 be given. Put M = sup ]/(x) J , let E be the set of points

Remove the segments (ui, vi) from [a, b]. The remaining set K is

Now form a partition P = {x0, x1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , xn} of [a, b], as follows: 
Each ui occurs in P. Each vi occurs in P. No point of any segment (ui, vi) 
occurs in P. If xi-i is not one of the ui, then fl.xi&lt;~-
Note that Mi -mi~ 2M for every i, and that Mi -mi~ e unless 
xi-i is one of the ui. Hence, as in the proof of Theorem 6.8,

Since e is arbitrary, Theorem 6.6 shows that/ e af(oc).

For i e A, our choice of~ shows that Mi* -mt'~ e.

Proof If f = fi + f2 and P is any partition of [a, b ], we have 
(20) L(P,f1, oc) + L(P,f2, oc) S L(P,f, oc) 
~ U(P,f, oc) S U(P,fi, oc) + U(P,f2, oc). 
If f1 e af(oc) and f2 e af(oc), let e &gt; 0 be given. There are partitions P1 
(j = 1, 2) such that 
	U(P1,Jj, oc) -L(P1,Jj, oc) &lt; e. </description></item></channel></rss>
