Proof The assertion follows from the inequality 
m m L ak ~ L I akl, 
k=n k&#8226;n 
plus the Cauchy criterion. 
3.46 Remarks For series of positive terms, absolute convergence is the same 
as convergence. 
If Lan converges, but L l an l diverges, we say that Lan converges non&#173;
absolutely. For instance, the series 
converges nonabsolutely (Theorem 3.43). 
The comparison test, as well as the root and ratio tests, is really a test for 
absolute convergence, and therefore cannot give any information about non&#173;
absolutely convergent series. Summation by parts can sometimes be used to 
handle the latter. In particular, power series converge absolutely in the interior 
of the circle of convergence. 
We shall see that we may operate with absolutely convergent series very 
much as with finite sums. We may multiply them term by term and we may 
change the order in which the additions are carried out, without affecting the 
sum of the series. But for nonabsolutely convergent series this is no longer true, 
and more care has to be taken when dealing with them. 
ADDITION AND MULTIPLICATION OF SERIES 
3.47 Theorem If Lan = A, and Lbn = B, then L(an + bn) = A + B, and 
Lean = cA, for any fixed c. 
Proof Let 
Then 
n 
An + Bn = L (ak + bk). 
k=O 
Since limn&#10132;oo An= A and limn&#10132;oo Bn = B, we see that 
n&#10132;oo 
The proof of the second assertion is even simpler. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 73 
Thus two convergent series may be added term by term, and the result&#173;
ing series converges to the sum of the two series. The situation becomes more 
complicated when we consider multiplication of two series. To begin with, we 
have to define the product. This can be done in several ways; we shall consider 
the so-called ''Cauchy product." 
3.48 Definition Given La" and Lb", we put 
" en= L akbn-k 
k=O (n=0,1,2, ... ) 
and call LC" the product of the two given series. 
This definition may be motivated as follows. If we take two power 
series Lanz" and "'&#163;b"z", multiply them term by term, and collect terms contain&#173;
ing the same power of z, we get 
00 00 L a" z" &#183; L bn z" = (a0 + a1z + a2 z2 + &#183; &#183; &#183;)(b0 + b1z + b2 z2 + &#183; &#183; &#183;) 
n=O n=O 
= a0 b0 + (a0 b1 + a1 b0}z + (a0 b2 + a1 b1 + a2 b0}z2 + &#183; &#183; &#183; 
= Co + C 1 Z + C 2 z2 + ' ' ' . 
Setting z = 1, we arrive at the above definition. 
3.49 Example If 
and A" &#10132; A, B" &#10132; B, then it is not at all clear that { C"} will converge to AB, 
since we do not have C" = A" B". The dependence of { C"} on {A"} and {.B"} is 
quite a complicated one (see the proof of Theorem 3.50). We shall now show 
that the product of two convergent series may actually diverge. 
The series 
00 ( -1)" 1 1 1 I ----;===1--+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; n=oJn + I J2 J3 J4

so that the condition en &#10132; 0, which is necessary for the convergence of l:cn , is 
not satisfied. 
In view of the next theorem, due to Mertens, we note that we have here 
considered the product of two nonabsolutely convergent series. 
3.50 Theorem Suppose 
Then 00

That is, the product of two convergent series converges, and to the right 
value, if at least one of the two series converges absolutely. 
Proof Put 
Then 
Cn = aobo + (aob1 + a1bo) + &#183; &#183; &#183; + (aobn + a1bn-1 + &#183; &#183;&#183; + anbo)

= AnB + aoPn + a1Pn-1 + ''' + anPo NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 75 
Put 
Yn = ao/Jn + a1/Jn-l +'''+an/Jo&#8226; 
We wish to show that Cn &#10132; AB. Since An B &#9658; AB, it suffices to 
show that 
(21) lim Yn = 0. 
Put 
[It is here that we use (a).] Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (c}, /Jn &#9658; 0. Hence we 
can choose N such that I /Jn I ~ e for n ~ N, in which case 
IYnl ~I/Joan+&#183;&#183;&#183;+ fJNan-NI + I/JN+lan-N-1 + &#183;&#183; &#183; + /Jnaol 
~I/Joan+&#183;&#183;&#183;+ fJNan-NI + ea. 
Keeping N fixed, and letting n &#10132; oo, we get 
lim sup I Yn I ~ ea, 
n&#10132;oo 
since ak &#10132; 0 ask&#10132; oo. Since e is arbitrary, (21) follows. 
Another question which may be asked is whether the series ten, if con&#173;
vergent, must have the sum AB. Abel showed that the answer _is in the affirma&#173;
tive. 
3.51 Theorem If the series tan, tbn, ten converge to A, B, C, and 
Cn = ao bn + ... + an ho' then C = AB. 
Here no assumption is made concerning absolute convergence. We shall 
give a simple proof (which depends on the continuity of power series) after 
Theorem 8.2. 
REARRANGEMENTS 
3.52 Definition Let {kn}, n = 1, 2, 3, ... , be a sequence in which every 
positive integer appears once and only once (that is, {kn} is a 1-1 function from 
J onto J, in the notation of Definition 2.2). Putting 
' a = ak n " (n=l,2,3, ... ), 
we say that ta~ is a rearrangement of tan . </description></item><item><title>9 Power Series</title><num_pages>5</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/9_Power_Series.pdf</link><description>NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 65 
The rapidity with which the series L 1 converges can be estimated as n! 
follows: If sn has the same meaning as above, we have 
1 1 1 e-s =---+---+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; n (n + 1) ! (n + 2) ! (n + 3) ! 
1 1 1 1 &lt;---1+--+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; =-(n + 1) ! n + 1 (n + 1)2 n !n

Thus s10, for instance, approximates e with an error less than 10-1. The 
inequality (16) is of theoretical interest as well, since it enables us to prove the 
irrationality of e very easily. 
3.32 Theorem e is irrational. 
(17) Proof Suppose e is rational. Then e = p/q, where p and q are positive 
integers. By (16), 
1 0 &lt;q!(e-sq) &lt;-&#183; q 
By our assumption, q!e is an integer. Since 
q!sq = q! 1 1 l+l+-+&#183;&#183;&#183;+-2 ! q! 
is an integer, we see that q!(e -sq) is an integer. 
Since q ~ l, (17) implies the existence of an integer between O and 1. 
We have thus reached a contradiction. 
Actually, e is not even an algebraic number. For a simple proof of this, 
see page 25 of Niven's book, or page 176 of Herstein's, cited in the Bibliography. 
THE ROOT AND RATIO TESTS 
3.33 Theorem (Root Test) Given :Ean, put a = lim sup ::/Ian I -
Then 
(a) if a&lt; 1, :Ean converges,&#183; 
(b) if a&gt; 1, :Ean diverges; 
(c) if a = 1, the test gives no information. 66 PRINCIPLES OP MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Proof If &#176;' &lt; 1, we can choose /J so that &#176;' &lt; /J &lt; 1, and an integer N 
such that 
n lanl &lt;/J 
for n ~ N [by Theorem 3.17(b)]. That is, n ~ N implies 
lanl &lt; pn. 
Since O &lt; /J &lt; 1, 'E/Jn converges. Convergence of '&#163;an follows now from 
the comparison test. 
If&#176;'&gt; 1, then, again by Theorem 3.17, there is a sequence {nk} such 
that 
Hence I an I &gt; 1 for infinitely many values of n, so that the condition 
an &#10132;O, necessary for convergence of '&#163;an, does not hold (Theorem 3.23). 
To prove (c), we consider the series 
For each of these series oc = 1, but the first diverges, the second converges. 
3.34 Theorem (Ratio Test) The series '&#163;an

n&#10132;oo an 
(b) diverges if an+t ~ 1 for all n ~ n0, where n0 is some.fixed integer. 
an 
Proof If condition (a) holds, we can find /J &lt; 1, and an integer N, such 
that 
&lt;/J 
for n ~ N. In particular, 
I aN + 1 I &lt; /JI aN I , 
I aN + 2 I &lt; /JI aN + 1 I &lt; /12 I aN I,

That is, 
lanl &lt; laNIP-N &#8226; pn 
for n ~ N, and (a) follows from the comparison test, since r,pn converges. 
If I an+ 1 I ~ I an I for n ~ n0, it is easily seen that the condition an &#10132; 0 
does not hold, and (b) follows. 
Note: The knowledge that lim an+1/an = 1 implies nothing about the 
convergence of !:.an. The series !:-1/n and !:.l/n2 demonstrate this.

3.36 Remarks The ratio test is frequently easier to apply than the root test, 
since it is usually easier to compute ratios than nth roots. However, the root 
test has wider scope. More precisely: Whenever the ratio test shows conver&#173;
gence, the root test does too; whenever the root test is inconclusive, the ratio 
test is too. This is a consequence of Theorem 3.37, and is illustrated by the 
above examples. 
Neither of the two tests is subtle with regard to divergence. Both deduce 
divergence from the fact that an does not tend to zero as n &gt; oo.

POWER SERIES 
3.38 Definition Given a sequence {en} of complex numbers, the series 
(19) 00 L CnZn 
n=O 
is called a power series. The numbers en are called the coefficients of the series; 
z is a complex number. 
In general, the series will converge or diverge, depending on the choice 
of z. More specifically, with every power series there is associated a circle, the 
circle of convergence, such that (19) converges if z is in the interior of the circle 
and diverges if z is in the exterior (to cover all cases, we have to consider the 
plane as the interior of a circle of infinite radius, and a point as a circle of radius 
zero). The behavior on the circle of convergence is much more varied and can&#173;
not be described so simply. 
3.39 Theorem Given the power series !:en zn, put 
n-+ oo 1 
R =-&#183; a 
(/fa= 0, R = +oo; if a= +oo, R = 0.) Then I:cnzn converges if lzl &lt; R, and 
diverges if I z I &gt; R. 
Proof Put an= cnzn, and apply the root test: 
Note: R is called the radius of convergence of .!:en zn. 
3.40 Examples 
(a) The series :Enn zn has R = 0. 
Zn 
(b) The series L I has R = + oo. (In this case the ratio test is easier to n. 
apply than the root test.) </description></item><item><title>8 The Root and Ratio Tests</title><num_pages>3</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/8_The_Root_and_Ratio_Tests.pdf</link><description>(11) 
(12) NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 63 
Proof The monotonicity of the logarithmic function (which will be 
discussed in more detail in Chap. 8) implies that {log n} increases. Hence 
{1/n log n} decreases, and we can apply Theorem 3.27 to (10); this 
leads us to the series 
00 1 00 1 1 001 L2k. ___ z:-----z:-
k= 1 2k(log 2k)P -k= 1 (k log 2)P -(log 2)P k= 1 kP' 
and Theorem 3.29 follows from Theorem 3.28. 
This procedure may evidently be continued. For instance, 
00 1 
n~3 n log n log log n 
diverges, whereas 
(13) 00 1 
n~3 n log n(log log n)2 
converges. 
We may now observe that the terms of the series (12) differ very little 
from those of (13). Still, one diverges, the other converges. If we continue the 
process which led us from Theorem 3.28 to Theorem 3.29, and then to (12) and 
(13), we get pairs of convergent and divergent series whose terms differ even 
less than those of (12) and (13). One might thus be led to the conjectt1re that 
there is a limiting situation of some sort, a ''boundary'' with all convergent 
series on one side, all divergent series on the other side:-at least as far as series 
with monotonic coefficients are concerned. This notion of ''boundary'' is of 
course quite vague. The point we wish to make is this: No matter how we make 
this notion precise, the conjecture is false. Exercises 11 (b) and 12(b) may serve 
as illustrations. 
We do not wish to go any deeper into this aspect of convergence theory, 
and refer the reader to Knopp's ''Theory and Application of Infinite Series," 
Chap. IX, particularly Sec. 41. 
THE NUMBER e

n=on! 
Here n ! = 1 &#183; 2 &#183; 3 &#183; &#183; &#183; n if n ~ 1, and O ! = 1. 64 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

1 1 1 &lt;1 +1 +-+--,-+&#183;&#183;&#183;+-&lt;3 2 22 2n-l , 
the series converges, and the definition makes sense. In fact, the series converges 
very rapidly and allows us to compute e with great accuracy. 
It is of interest to note that e can also be defined by means of another 
limit process; the proof provides a good illustration of operations with limits: 
3.31 Theorem lim 
Proof Let 1 n 
1 + -= e. n 
n 1 
Sn= L kl, 
k=O &#8226; 
By the binomial theorem, 
1

Hence tn ~Sn' so that 1 1 - -n 1 n 
t = l+-&#183; n 
2 1 - -n n

1 1 +-1--n! n 2 1 - -n 
(14) lim sup tn ~ e, 
n&#10132;oo 
by Theorem 3.19. Next, if n ~ m, n-1 ... 1---
n 
1 
tn ~ 1 + 1 + 2 1 1-&#173;n 1 + ... +-1 1-&#173;n m-1 ... 1--- &#8226; ml n 
Let n &#10132; oo, keeping m fixed. We get 
1 
n&#10132;oo 
so that 
n-+ oo 
Letting m &gt; oo, we finally get 
(15) e ~ lim inf tn. 
n-+ oo 
The theorem follows from (14) and (15). &#8226; NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 65 
The rapidity with which the series L 1 converges can be estimated as n! 
follows: If sn has the same meaning as above, we have 
1 1 1 e-s =---+---+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; n (n + 1) ! (n + 2) ! (n + 3) ! 
1 1 1 1 &lt;---1+--+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; =-(n + 1) ! n + 1 (n + 1)2 n !n 
so that 
(16) 1 
0 &lt; e-s &lt; -&#183; 
n n!n 
Thus s10, for instance, approximates e with an error less than 10-1. The 
inequality (16) is of theoretical interest as well, since it enables us to prove the 
irrationality of e very easily. 
3.32 Theorem e is irrational. 
(17) Proof Suppose e is rational. Then e = p/q, where p and q are positive 
integers. By (16), 
1 0 &lt;q!(e-sq) &lt;-&#183; q 
By our assumption, q!e is an integer. Since 
q!sq = q! 1 1 l+l+-+&#183;&#183;&#183;+-2 ! q! 
is an integer, we see that q!(e -sq) is an integer. 
Since q ~ l, (17) implies the existence of an integer between O and 1. 
We have thus reached a contradiction. 
Actually, e is not even an algebraic number. For a simple proof of this, 
see page 25 of Niven's book, or page 176 of Herstein's, cited in the Bibliography.

SERIES 
In the remainder of this chapter, all sequences and series under consideration 
will be complex-valued, unless the contrary is explicitly stated. Extensions of 
some of the theorems which follow, to series with terms in Rk, are mentioned 
in Exercise 15. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SER.IES 59 
3.21 Definition Given a sequence {an}, we use the notation 
n=p 
to denote the sum aP + ap+l + &#183; &#183; &#183; + aq. With {an} we associate a sequence 
{sn}, where 
For {sn} we also use the symbolic expression 
a1 + a2 + a3 + ... 
or, more concisely, 
00 
(4) Lan. 
n=l 
The symbol (4) we call an in.finite series, or just a series. The numbers 
Sn are called the partial sums of the series. If {sn} converges to s, we say that 
the series converges, and write 
00 
Lan= s. 
n= 1 
The number s is called the sum of the series; but it should be clearly under&#173;
stood that s is the limit of a sequence of sums, and is not obtained simply by 
addition. 
If {sn} diverges, the series is said to diverge. 
Sometimes, for convenience of notation, we shall consider series of the 
form 
00 
(5) Lan. 
n=O 
And frequently, when there is no possible ambiguity, or when the distinction 
is immaterial, we shall simply write :I:an in place of (4) or (5). 
It is clear that every theorem about sequences can be stated in terms of 
series (putting a1 = s1, and an = Sn -Sn -i for n &gt; 1 ), and vice versa. But it is 
nevertheless useful to consider both concepts. 
The Cauchy criterion (Theorem 3.11) can be restated in the following 
form: 
3.22 Theorem :I:an converges if and only if for every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that 
(6) 
if m ~ n ~ N. 60 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
In particular, by taking m = n, (6) becomes 
I an I ~ B (n ~ N). 
In other words: 
3.23 Theorem lf :I:an converges, then limn&#10132;oo an = 0. 
The condition an&#10132; 0 is not, however, sufficient to ensure convergence 
of :I:an. For instance, the series 
CX) 1 I -
n= 1 n 
diverges; for the proof we refer to Theorem 3.28. 
Theorem 3.14, concerning monotonic sequences, also has an immediate 
counterpart for series. 
3.24 Theorem A series of nonnegative1 terms converges if and only if its 
partial sums form a bounded sequence. 
We now tum to a convergence test of a different nature, the so-called 
''comparison test." 
3.25 Theorem 
(a) If I an I ~ Cn for n ~ N0, where N0 is some fixed integer, and if :I:cn 
converges, then :I:an converges.

By (8) and (9), the sequences {sn} and {tk} are either both bounded 
or both unbounded. This completes the proof. 
I Theorem I -converges if p &gt; 1 and diverges if p ~ 1. nP 
Proof If p ~ 0, divergence follows from Theorem 3.23. If p &gt; 0, 
Theorem 3.27 is applicable, and we are led to the series 
C() 1 C() '&#176;' 2k. __ '&#176;' 2(1-p)k

Now, 21-p &lt; 1 if and only if 1 -p &lt; 0, and the result follows by com&#173;
parison with the geometric series (take x = 21-P in Theorem 3.26). 
As a further application of Theorem 3.27, we prove: 
3.29 Theorem If p &gt; 1, 
C() 1 
n~2 n(lo 
converges,&#183; if p ~ 1, the series diverges. (10) 
Remark ''log n'' denotes the logarithm of n to the base e (compare Exercise 7, 
Chap. 1); the number e will be defined in a moment (see Definition 3.30). We 
let the series start with n = 2, since log 1 = 0. (11) 
(12) NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 63 
Proof The monotonicity of the logarithmic function (which will be 
discussed in more detail in Chap. 8) implies that {log n} increases. Hence 
{1/n log n} decreases, and we can apply Theorem 3.27 to (10); this 
leads us to the series 
00 1 00 1 1 001 L2k. ___ z:-----z:-
k= 1 2k(log 2k)P -k= 1 (k log 2)P -(log 2)P k= 1 kP' 
and Theorem 3.29 follows from Theorem 3.28. 
This procedure may evidently be continued. For instance, 
00 1 
n~3 n log n log log n 
diverges, whereas 
(13) 00 1 
n~3 n log n(log log n)2 
converges. 
We may now observe that the terms of the series (12) differ very little 
from those of (13). Still, one diverges, the other converges. If we continue the 
process which led us from Theorem 3.28 to Theorem 3.29, and then to (12) and 
(13), we get pairs of convergent and divergent series whose terms differ even 
less than those of (12) and (13). One might thus be led to the conjectt1re that 
there is a limiting situation of some sort, a ''boundary'' with all convergent 
series on one side, all divergent series on the other side:-at least as far as series 
with monotonic coefficients are concerned. This notion of ''boundary'' is of 
course quite vague. The point we wish to make is this: No matter how we make 
this notion precise, the conjecture is false. Exercises 11 (b) and 12(b) may serve 
as illustrations. 
We do not wish to go any deeper into this aspect of convergence theory, 
and refer the reader to Knopp's ''Theory and Application of Infinite Series," 
Chap. IX, particularly Sec. 41.

To show that Pis perfect, it is enough to show that P contains no isolated 
point. Let x e P, and let S be any segment containing x. Let In be that interval 
of En which contains x. Choose n large enough, so that In c S. Let Xn be an 
endpoint of In, such that Xn :#: x. 
It follows from the construction of P that Xn e P. Hence xis a limit point 
of P, and P is perfect. 
One of the most interesting properties of the Cantor set is that it provides 
us with an example of an uncountable set of measure zero (the concept of 
measure will be discussed in Chap. 11). 
CONNECTED SETS 
2.45 Definition Two subsets A and B of a metric space X are said to be 
separated if both A n Band An Bare empty, i.e., if no point of A lies in the 
closure of Band no point of B lies in the closure of A. 
A set E c X is said to be connected if E is not a union of two nonempty 
separated sets. 
2.46 Remark Separated sets are of course disjoint, but disjoint sets need not 
be separated. For example, the interval [O, 1] and the segment (1, 2) are not 
separated, since 1 is a limit point of (1, 2). However, the segments (0, 1) and 
(1, 2) are separated. 
The connected subsets of the line have a particularly simple structure: 
2.47 Theorem A subset E of the real line R1 is connected if and only if it has the 
following property: If x e &#163;,ye&#163;, and x &lt; z &lt; y, then z e &#163;. I 
Proof If there exist x e &#163;,ye&#163;, and some z e (x, y) such that z &#162; E, then 
E = A:z u B:z where 
A:z =En (-oo, z), B:z =En (z, oo). BASIC TOPOLOGY 43 
Since x e Az and ye Bz, A and Bare nonempty. Since Az c: (-oo, z) and 
Bz c: (z, oo ), they are separated. Hence E is not connected. 
To prove the converse, suppose Eis not connected. Then there are 
nonempty separated sets A and B such that A u B = E. Pick x e A, y e B, 
and assume (without loss of generality) that x &lt; y. Define 
z = sup (A n [x, y]). 
By Theorem 2.28, z e A; hence z &#162; B. In particular, x ~ z &lt; y. 
If z &#162; A, it follows that x &lt; z &lt; y and z &#162; E. 
If z e A, then z &#162; B, hence there exists z1 such that z &lt; z1 &lt; y and 
z1 &#162; B. Then x &lt; z1 &lt; y and z1 &#162; E.

is true: For every x e X and every open set G c X such that x E G, we have

disjoint segments. Hint: Use Exercise 22. 46 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
30. Imitate the proof of Theorem 2.43 to obtain the following result: 
If Rk = U f Fn, where each Fn is a closed subset of Rk, then at least one Fn 
has a nonempty interior. 
Equivalent statement: If Gn is a dense open subset of Rk, for n = 1, 2, 3, ... , 
then nron is not empty (in fact, it is dense in R"). 
(This is a special case of Baire's theorem; see Exercise 22, Chap. 3, for the general 
case.) NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 
As the title indicates, this chapter will deal primarily with sequences and series 
of complex numbers. The basic facts about convergence, however, are just as 
easily explained in a more general setting. The first three sections will the ref ore 
be concerned with sequences in euclidean spaces, or even in metric spaces. 
CONVERGENT SEQUENCES 
3.1 Definition A sequence {Pn} in a metric space Xis said to converge if there 
is a point p e X with the following property: For every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that n ~ N implies that d(pn, p) &lt; e. (Here d denotes the distance in X.) 
In this case we also say that {Pn} converges to p, or that p is the limit of 
{Pn} [see Theorem 3.2(b)], and we write Pn &#10132; p, or 
lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
If {Pn} does not converge, it is said to diverge. </description></item><item><title>2 Cauchy Sequences</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/2_Cauchy_Sequences.pdf</link><description>NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 51 
(b) Suppose {x,,}, {Yn} are sequences in Rk, {Pn} is a sequence of real numbers, 
and Xn &#10132; x, Yn &gt; y, Pn &#10132; p. Then 
lim (Xn + Yn) = X + Y, lim Xn &#8226; Yn = X. y, lim Pn Xn = f3x. 
n&#10132;oo n&#10132;oo n&#10132;oo 
Proof 
(a) If Xn &#10132; x, the inequalities 
l&#176;'J,n -&#183; &#176;'JI S lxn -xi, 
which follow immediately from the definition of the norm in Rk, show that 
(2) holds. 
Conversely, if (2) holds, then to each e &gt; 0 there corresponds an 
integer N such that n ~ N implies 
(1 Sj S k). 
Hence n ~ N implies 
k 1/2 
lxn -xi = L l&#176;'J,n -&#176;'112 &lt; B, J=l 
so that Xn &gt; x. This proves (a). 
Part (b) follows from (a) and Theorem 3.3. 
SUBSEQUENCES 
3.S Definition Given a sequence {pn}, consider a sequence {nk} of positive 
integers, such that n1 &lt; n2 &lt; n3 &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183; . Then the sequence {Pn,} is called a 
subsequence of {Pn}. If {Pn,} converges, its limit is called a subsequential limit 
of {Pn}. 
It is clear that {Pn} converges to p if and only if every subsequence of 
{Pn} converges top. We leave the details of the proof to the reader. 
3.6 Theorem 
(a) If {Pn} is a sequence in a compact metric space X, then some sub&#173;
sequence of {Pn} converges to a point of X. 
(b) Every bounded sequence in Rk contains a convergent subsequence. 52 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Proof 
(a) Let Ebe the range of {Pn}. If Eis finite then there is ape E and a 
sequence {n1} with n1 &lt; n2 &lt; n3 &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183;, such that 
P -p -&#183;&#183;&#183;-p n, -na --&#8226; 
The subsequence {Pn1} so obtained converges evidently to p. 
If E is infinite, Theorem 2.37 shows that E has a limit point p e X. 
Choose n1 so that d(P,Pn1) &lt; 1. Having chosen n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1, we see from 
Theorem 2.20 that there is an integer n1 &gt; n1_1 such that d(P,Pn,) &lt; 1/i. 
Then {Pn,} converges top. 
(b) This follows from (a), since Theorem 2.41 implies that every bounded 
subset of Rk lies in a compact subset of Rk. 
3.7 Theorem The subsequential limits of a sequence {Pn} in a metric space X 
form a closed subset of X. 
Proof Let E* be the set of all subsequential limits of {Pn} and let q be a 
limit point of E*. We have to show that q e E*. 
Choose n1 so that Pn1 =I= q. (If no such n1 exists, then E* has only 
one point, and there is nothing to prove.) Put ~ = d(q, Pn1). Suppose 
n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1 are chosen. Since q is a limit point of E*, there is an x e E* 
with d(x, q) &lt; 2-1
~. Since x e E*, there is an n1 &gt; n1_1 such that 
d(x,Pn,) &lt; 2-1~. Thus 
d(q, Pn,) ~ 21-1~ 
for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . . This says that {Pn,} converges to q. Hence q e E*. 
CAUCHY SEQUENCES 
3.8 Definition A sequence {pn} in a metric space X is said to be a Cauchy 
sequence if for every s &gt; 0 there is an integer N such that d(pn , Pm) &lt; e if n ~ N 
and m ~N. 
In our discussion of Cauchy sequences, as well as in other situations 
which will arise later, the following geometric concept will be useful. 
3.9 Definition Let E be a nonempty subset of a metric space X, and let S be

1d(p, q), with .p e E and q e E. The sup

SERIES 
In the remainder of this chapter, all sequences and series under consideration 
will be complex-valued, unless the contrary is explicitly stated. Extensions of 
some of the theorems which follow, to series with terms in Rk, are mentioned 
in Exercise 15. </description></item><item><title>11 Absolute Convergence</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/11_Absolute_Convergence.pdf</link><description>70 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

SUMMATION BY PARTS 
3.41 Theorem Given two sequences {an}, {b,,}, put

Proof 
and the last expression on the right is clearly equal to the right side of 
(20). 
Formula (20), the so-called ''partial summation formula," is useful in the 
investigation of series of the form :Eanbn, particularly when {bn} is monotonic. 
We shall now give applications.

plus the Cauchy criterion. 
3.46 Remarks For series of positive terms, absolute convergence is the same 
as convergence. 
If Lan converges, but L l an l diverges, we say that Lan converges non&#173;
absolutely. For instance, the series 
converges nonabsolutely (Theorem 3.43). 
The comparison test, as well as the root and ratio tests, is really a test for 
absolute convergence, and therefore cannot give any information about non&#173;
absolutely convergent series. Summation by parts can sometimes be used to 
handle the latter. In particular, power series converge absolutely in the interior 
of the circle of convergence. 
We shall see that we may operate with absolutely convergent series very 
much as with finite sums. We may multiply them term by term and we may 
change the order in which the additions are carried out, without affecting the 
sum of the series. But for nonabsolutely convergent series this is no longer true, 
and more care has to be taken when dealing with them. 
ADDITION AND MULTIPLICATION OF SERIES

Theorem 3.2(c) and example (d) of Definition 3.1 show that convergent 
sequences are bounded, but that bounded sequences in Rk need not converge. 
However, there is one important case in which convergence is equivalent to 
boundedness; this happens for monotonic sequences in R1&#8226; 
3.13 Definition A sequence {sn} of real numbers is said to be 
(a) monotonically increasing if Sn~ Sn+l (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ); 
(b) monotonically decreasing if Sn~ Sn+i (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
The class of monotonic sequences consists of the increasing and the 
decreasing sequences. 
3.14 Theorem Suppose {sn} is monotonic. Then {sn} converges if and only if it 
is bounded. 
Proof Suppose Sn~ Sn+i (the proof is analogous in the other case). 
Let E be the range of {sn}. If {sn} is bounded, let s be the least upper 
bound of E. Then 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
For every B &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that 
for otherwise s -s would be an upper bound of E. Since {sn} increases, 
n ~ N the ref ore implies 
s -e &lt;Sn~ s, 
which shows that {sn} converges (to s). 
The converse follows from Theorem 3.2(c). 
UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS 
3.15 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers with the following 
property: For every real 1\1 there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M. We then write 
Sn&#10132;+OO. 
Similarly, if for every real M there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M, we write 
Sn &#9658; -00. 56 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
It should be noted that we now use the symbol &#10132; (introduced in Defini&#173;
tion 3.1) for certain types of divergent sequences, as well as for convergent 
sequences, but that the definitions of convergence and of limit, given in Defini&#173;
tion 3.1, are in no way changed. 
3.16 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers. Let Ebe the set of 
numbers x (in the extended real number system) such that sn,. ) x for some 
subsequence {j'n,.}. This set E contains all subsequential limits as defined in 
Definition 3.5, plus possibly the numbers + oo, -oo. 
We now recall Definitions 1.8 and 1.23 and put 
s* = sup E, 
s* = inf E. 
The numbers s*, s* are called the upper and lower limits of {sn}; we use the 
notation 
lim sup Sn= s*, lim inf Sn = s*. 
n&#10132;oo ft&#10132; 00 
3.17 Theorem Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers. Let E ands* have the 
same meaning as in Definition 3.16. Thens* has the following two properties: 
(a) s* e E. 
(b) If x &gt; s*, there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies Sn &lt; x. 
Moreover, s* is the only number with the properties (a) and (b). 
Of course, an analogous result is true for s*. 
Proof 
(a) Ifs* = + oo, then Eis not bounded above; hence {sn} is not bounded 
above, and there is a subsequence {sn,.} such that sn,. ) + oo. 
Ifs* is real, then Eis bounded above, and at least one subsequential 
limit exists, so that (a) follows from Theorems 3.7 and 2.28. 
If s* = -oo, then E contains only one element, namely -oo, and 
there is no subsequential limit. Hence, for any real M, Sn &gt; M for at 
most a finite number of values of n, so that sn ) -oo. 
This establishes (a) in all cases. 
(b) Suppose there is a number x &gt; s* such that Sn ~ x for infinitely 
many values of n. In that case, there is a number ye E such that 
y ~ x &gt; s*, contradicting the definition of s*. 
Thuss* satisfies (a) and (b). 
To show the uniqueness, suppose there are two numbers, p and q, 
which satisfy (a) and (b), and suppose p &lt; q. Choose x such thatp &lt; x &lt; q. 
Since p satisfies (b), we have sn &lt; x for n ~ N. But then q cannot satisfy (a). NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 57

Proof 
(a) Let Ebe the range of {Pn}. If Eis finite then there is ape E and a 
sequence {n1} with n1 &lt; n2 &lt; n3 &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183;, such that 
P -p -&#183;&#183;&#183;-p n, -na --&#8226; 
The subsequence {Pn1} so obtained converges evidently to p. 
If E is infinite, Theorem 2.37 shows that E has a limit point p e X. 
Choose n1 so that d(P,Pn1) &lt; 1. Having chosen n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1, we see from 
Theorem 2.20 that there is an integer n1 &gt; n1_1 such that d(P,Pn,) &lt; 1/i. 
Then {Pn,} converges top. 
(b) This follows from (a), since Theorem 2.41 implies that every bounded 
subset of Rk lies in a compact subset of Rk. 
3.7 Theorem The subsequential limits of a sequence {Pn} in a metric space X 
form a closed subset of X. 
Proof Let E* be the set of all subsequential limits of {Pn} and let q be a 
limit point of E*. We have to show that q e E*. 
Choose n1 so that Pn1 =I= q. (If no such n1 exists, then E* has only 
one point, and there is nothing to prove.) Put ~ = d(q, Pn1). Suppose 
n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1 are chosen. Since q is a limit point of E*, there is an x e E* 
with d(x, q) &lt; 2-1
~. Since x e E*, there is an n1 &gt; n1_1 such that 
d(x,Pn,) &lt; 2-1~. Thus 
d(q, Pn,) ~ 21-1~ 
for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . . This says that {Pn,} converges to q. Hence q e E*. 
CAUCHY SEQUENCES 
3.8 Definition A sequence {pn} in a metric space X is said to be a Cauchy 
sequence if for every s &gt; 0 there is an integer N such that d(pn , Pm) &lt; e if n ~ N 
and m ~N. 
In our discussion of Cauchy sequences, as well as in other situations 
which will arise later, the following geometric concept will be useful. 
3.9 Definition Let E be a nonempty subset of a metric space X, and let S be 
-- -the set of all real numbers of the form 
1d(p, q), with .p e E and q e E. The sup 
of S is called the diameter of E. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 53 
If{pn} is a sequence in X and if EN consists of the points PN, PN+ 1,PN+2, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , 
it is clear from the two preceding definitions that {Pn} is a Cauc/1y sequence 
if and only if 
lim diam EN= 0. 
N-+oo 
3.10 Theorem 
(a) If E is the closure of a set E in a metric space X, then 
diam E = diam E. 
(b) If Kn is a sequence of compact sets in X such that Kn::::, Kn+i 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) and if 
lim diam Kn= 0, 
n&#10132;oo 
then n '? Kn consists of exactly one point. 
Proof 
(a) Since E c E, it is clear that 
diam E::; diam E. 
Fix a &gt; 0, and choose p E E, q E &#163;. By the definition of E, there are 
points p', q', in E such that d(p, p') &lt; s, d(q, q') &lt; B. Hence 
d(p, q) ::; d(p, p') + d(p' q') + d(q', q) 
&lt; 2s + d(p', q') ~ 2s -+ diam E. 
It follows that 
diam E ~ 2s + diam E, 
and since e was arbitrary, (a) is proved. 
(b) Put K = n '?Kn. By Theorem 2.36, K is not empty. If K contains 
more than one point, then diam K &gt; 0. But for each n, Kn ::::, K, so that 
diam Kn ~ diam K. This contradicts the assumption that diam Kn ---+ 0. 
3.11 Theorem 
(a) In any metric space X, every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. 
(b) If Xis a compact metric space and if {Pn} is a Cauchy sequence in X, 
then {pn} converges to some point of X. 
(c) In Rk, every Cauchy sequence converges. 
Note: The difference between the definition of convergence and 
the definition of a Cauchy sequence is that the limit is explicitly involved 
in the former, but not in the latter. Thus Theorem 3.11 (b) may enable us 54 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(3) to decide whether or not a given sequence converges without knowledge 
of the limit to which it may converge. 
The fact (contained in Theorem 3.11) that a sequence converges in 
Rk if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence is usually called the Cauchy 
criterion for convergence. 
Proof 
(a) If Pn &#10132; p and if e &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that d(p, Pn) &lt; e 
for all n ~ N. Hence 
d(pn, p,,.) ~ d(pn, p) + d(p, Pm) &lt; 2B 
as soon as n ~ N and m ~ N. Thus {pn} is a Cauchy sequence. 
(b) Let {Pn} be a Cauchy sequence in the compact space X. For 
N = 1, 2, 3, ... , let EN be the set consisting of PN, PN+t, PN+2, .... 
Then 
lim diam EN= 0, 
N&#10132;oo 
by Definition 3.9 and Theorem 3. lO(a). Being a closed subset of the 
compact space X, each EN is compact (Theorem 2.35). Also EN:::&gt; EN+i, 
so that EN=&gt; EN+1&#8226; 
Theorem 3.lO(b) shows now that there is a unique p EX which lies 
in every EN. 
Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (3) there is an integer NO such that 
diam EN &lt; e if N ~ N0&#8226; Since p E EN, it follows that d(p, q) &lt; B for 
every q E EN, hence for every q E EN. In other words, d(p, Pn) &lt; e if 
n ~ NO &#8226; This says precisely that Pn &#8226; p. 
(c) Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in Rk. Define EN as in (b), with x, 
in place of Pi. For some N, diam EN&lt; 1. The range of {xn} is the union 
of EN and the finite set {x1, ... , xN-1}. Hence {xn} is bounded. Since 
every bounded subset of Rk has compact closure in Rk (Theorem 2.41), 
(c) follows from (b). 
3.12 Definition A metric space in which every Cauchy sequence converges is 
said to be complete. 
Thus Theorem 3.11 says that all compact metric spaces and all Euclidean 
spaces are complete. Theorem 3.11 implies also that every closed subset E of&#183; a 
complete metric space Xis complete. (Every Cauchy sequence in Eis a Cauchy 
sequence in X, hence it converges to some p EX, and actually p e E since Eis 
closed.) An example of a metric space which is not complete is the space of all 
rational numbers, with d(x, y) = Ix -YI. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 55 
Theorem 3.2(c) and example (d) of Definition 3.1 show that convergent 
sequences are bounded, but that bounded sequences in Rk need not converge. 
However, there is one important case in which convergence is equivalent to 
boundedness; this happens for monotonic sequences in R1&#8226; 
3.13 Definition A sequence {sn} of real numbers is said to be 
(a) monotonically increasing if Sn~ Sn+l (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ); 
(b) monotonically decreasing if Sn~ Sn+i (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
The class of monotonic sequences consists of the increasing and the 
decreasing sequences. 
3.14 Theorem Suppose {sn} is monotonic. Then {sn} converges if and only if it 
is bounded. 
Proof Suppose Sn~ Sn+i (the proof is analogous in the other case). 
Let E be the range of {sn}. If {sn} is bounded, let s be the least upper 
bound of E. Then 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
For every B &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that 
for otherwise s -s would be an upper bound of E. Since {sn} increases, 
n ~ N the ref ore implies 
s -e &lt;Sn~ s, 
which shows that {sn} converges (to s). 
The converse follows from Theorem 3.2(c). 
UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS 
3.15 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers with the following 
property: For every real 1\1 there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M. We then write

Similarly, if for every real M there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies

As the title indicates, this chapter will deal primarily with sequences and series 
of complex numbers. The basic facts about convergence, however, are just as 
easily explained in a more general setting. The first three sections will the ref ore 
be concerned with sequences in euclidean spaces, or even in metric spaces. 
CONVERGENT SEQUENCES 
3.1 Definition A sequence {Pn} in a metric space Xis said to converge if there 
is a point p e X with the following property: For every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that n ~ N implies that d(pn, p) &lt; e. (Here d denotes the distance in X.) 
In this case we also say that {Pn} converges to p, or that p is the limit of 
{Pn} [see Theorem 3.2(b)], and we write Pn &#10132; p, or 
lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
If {Pn} does not converge, it is said to diverge. 48 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
It might be well to point out that our definition of ''convergent sequence'' 
depends not only on {Pn} but also on X; for instance, the sequence {1/n} con&#173;
verges in R1 (to 0), but fails to converge in the set of all positive real numbers 
[with d(x, y) = Ix -y I]. In cases of possible ambiguity, we can be more 
precise and specify ''convergent in X'' rather than ''convergent." 
We recall that the set of all points Pn (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) is the range of {Pn}. 
The range of a sequence may be a finite set, or it may be infinite. The sequence 
{p n} is said to be bounded if its range is bounded. 
As examples, consider the following sequences of complex numbers 
(that is, X = R2): 
(a) If sn = 1/n, then limn-+oo sn = O; the range is infinite, and the sequence 
is bounded. 
(b) If sn = n2, the sequence {sn} is unbounded, is divergent, and has 
infinite range. 
(c) If sn = 1 + [( -l)n/n], the sequence {sn} converges to I, is bounded, 
and has infinite range. 
(d) If sn = in, the sequence {sn} is divergent, is bounded, and has finite 
range. 
(e) If sn = 1 (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), then {sn} converges to 1, is bounded, and 
&#8226; 
has finite range. 
We now summarize some important properties of convergent sequences 
in metric spaces. 
3.2 Theorem Let {p n} be a sequence in a metric space X. 
(a) {Pn} converges to p e X if and only if every neighborhood o.f p contains 
Pn for all but finitely many n. 
(b) If p e X, p' e X, and if {Pn} converges top and top', then p' = p. 
(c) If {Pn} converges, then {Pn} is bounded. 
(d) If E c X and if p is a limit point of E, then there is a sequence {Pn} in E 
such that p = lim Pn .

Proof (a) Suppose Pn &#10132; p and let V be a neighborhood of p. For 
some e &gt; 0, the conditions d(q, p) &lt; e, q e X imply q e V. Correspond&#173;
ing to this e, there exists N such that n ~ N implies d(p n, p) &lt; e. Thus 
n ~ N implies Pn E V. 
Conversely, suppose every neighborhood of p contains all but 
finitely many of the Pn. Fix e &gt; 0, and let V be the set of all q e X such 
that d(p, q) &lt; e. By assumption, there exists N (corresponding to this V) 
such that Pn E V if n ~ N. Thus d(pn, p) &lt; e if n ~ N; hence Pn &gt; p. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 49 
(b) Let e &gt; 0 be given. There exist integers N, N' such that 
n~N implies 
n ~ N' implies 
Hence if n ~ max (N, N'), we have 
d(p, p') ~ d(p, Pn) + d(pn, p') &lt; e. 
Since e was arbitrary, we conclude that d(p, p') = 0. 
(c) Suppose Pn &#8226; p. There is an integer N such that n &gt; N 
implies d(pn, p) &lt; 1. Put 
r = max {l, d(p1, p), ... , d(pN, p)}. 
Then d(pn,P) ~ r for n = 1, 2, 3, .... 
(d) For each positive integer n, there is a point Pn e E such that 
d(pn, p) &lt; 1/n. Given e &gt; 0, choose N so that Ne&gt; 1. If n &gt; N, it 
follows that d(pn, p) &lt; e. Hence Pn &gt; p. 
This completes the proof. 
For sequences in Rk we can study the relation between convergence, on 
the one hand, and the algebraic operations on the other. We first consider 
sequences of complex numbers. 
3.3 Theorem Suppose {sn}, {tn} are complex sequences, and limn&#10132;oo Sn = s,

Proof 
(a) Given e &gt; 0, there exist integers N1, N2 such that 
n ~ N 1 implies 
n ~ N 2 implies &#8226; 50 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(1) If N = max (N1, N2), then n ~ N implies 
I (sn + tn) -(s + t) I ~ I Sn -SI + I tn -t I &lt; B. 
This proves (a). The proof of (b) is trivial. 
(c) We use the identity 
Sntn -st = (sn -s)(tn -t) + s(tn -t) + t(sn -s). 
Given e &gt; 0, there are integers N1, N2 such that 
n ~ N1 implies lsn -sl &lt; J;, 
n ~ N2 implies I tn -ti &lt; J;. 
If we take N = max (N1, N2), n ~ N implies 
I (sn -s)(tn -t)I &lt; B, 
so that 
lim (sn -s)(tn -t) = 0.

We now apply (a) and (b) to (1), and conclude that 
lim (sntn -st)= 0.

(d) Choosing m such that I sn -s I &lt; &#189;Is I if n ~ m, we see that 
(n ~ m).

(2) holds. 
Conversely, if (2) holds, then to each e &gt; 0 there corresponds an

3.S Definition Given a sequence {pn}, consider a sequence {nk} of positive 
integers, such that n1 &lt; n2 &lt; n3 &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183; . Then the sequence {Pn,} is called a 
subsequence of {Pn}. If {Pn,} converges, its limit is called a subsequential limit 
of {Pn}. 
It is clear that {Pn} converges to p if and only if every subsequence of 
{Pn} converges top. We leave the details of the proof to the reader.

POWER SERIES 
3.38 Definition Given a sequence {en} of complex numbers, the series 
(19) 00 L CnZn 
n=O 
is called a power series. The numbers en are called the coefficients of the series; 
z is a complex number. 
In general, the series will converge or diverge, depending on the choice 
of z. More specifically, with every power series there is associated a circle, the 
circle of convergence, such that (19) converges if z is in the interior of the circle 
and diverges if z is in the exterior (to cover all cases, we have to consider the 
plane as the interior of a circle of infinite radius, and a point as a circle of radius 
zero). The behavior on the circle of convergence is much more varied and can&#173;
not be described so simply. 
3.39 Theorem Given the power series !:en zn, put

R =-&#183; a 
(/fa= 0, R = +oo; if a= +oo, R = 0.) Then I:cnzn converges if lzl &lt; R, and 
diverges if I z I &gt; R. 
Proof Put an= cnzn, and apply the root test: 
Note: R is called the radius of convergence of .!:en zn. 
3.40 Examples 
(a) The series :Enn zn has R = 0. 
Zn 
(b) The series L I has R = + oo. (In this case the ratio test is easier to n. 
apply than the root test.) 70 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(c) The series :Ezn has R = 1. If lzl = 1, the series diverges, since {zn} 
does not tend to O as n &#10132; oo. 
n 
(d) The series L :._ has R = 1. It diverges if z = 1. It converges for all n 
other z with I z I = 1. (The last assertion will be proved in Theorem 3.44.) 
n 
(e) The series L z2 has R = 1. It converges for all z with I z I = 1, by n 
the comparison test, since I zn/n21 = 1/n2&#8226; 
SUMMATION BY PARTS 
3.41 Theorem Given two sequences {an}, {b,,}, put 
ifn ~ O; put A_1 = 0. Then, ifO ~p ~ q, we have 
(20) q q-1 L anbn = L An(bn -hn+1) + Aqbq -Ap-lbp. 
n=p n=p 
Proof 
and the last expression on the right is clearly equal to the right side of 
(20). 
Formula (20), the so-called ''partial summation formula," is useful in the 
investigation of series of the form :Eanbn, particularly when {bn} is monotonic. 
We shall now give applications.

Put 
Yn = ao/Jn + a1/Jn-l +'''+an/Jo&#8226; 
We wish to show that Cn &#10132; AB. Since An B &#9658; AB, it suffices to

(21) lim Yn = 0. 
Put 
[It is here that we use (a).] Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (c}, /Jn &#9658; 0. Hence we

since ak &#10132; 0 ask&#10132; oo. Since e is arbitrary, (21) follows. 
Another question which may be asked is whether the series ten, if con&#173;
vergent, must have the sum AB. Abel showed that the answer _is in the affirma&#173;
tive. 
3.51 Theorem If the series tan, tbn, ten converge to A, B, C, and 
Cn = ao bn + ... + an ho' then C = AB. 
Here no assumption is made concerning absolute convergence. We shall 
give a simple proof (which depends on the continuity of power series) after 
Theorem 8.2. 
REARRANGEMENTS 
3.52 Definition Let {kn}, n = 1, 2, 3, ... , be a sequence in which every 
positive integer appears once and only once (that is, {kn} is a 1-1 function from 
J onto J, in the notation of Definition 2.2). Putting 
' a = ak n " (n=l,2,3, ... ), 
we say that ta~ is a rearrangement of tan . 76 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
If {sn}, {s~} are the sequences of partial sums of tan, ta~, it is easily seen 
that, in general, these two sequences consist of entirely different numbers. 
We are thus led to the problem of determining under what conditions all 
rearrangements of a convergent series will converge and whether the sums are 
necessarily the same. 
3.53 Example Consider the convergent series 
(22) 1-&#189;+&#188;-&#188;+&#189;--l;+&#183;&#183;&#183; 
and one of its rearrangements 
(23) 1 + &#188; -&#189; + t + t -&#188; + &#189; + 111 -&#188; + ... 
in which two positive terms are always followed by one negative. If s is the 
sum of (22), then 
s &lt; 1 -&#189; + &#189; = i, 
Since 
1 1 1 
- 3 + 4k -1 -2k &gt; O 
for k ~ 1, we see that s; &lt; s~ &lt; s~ &lt; &#183; &#183; &#183; , where s~ is nth partial sum of (23). 
Hence 
1. , , _S_ Im sup Sn &gt; S3 = 0, 
n&#10132;oo 
so that (23) certainly does not converge to s [we leave it to the reader to verify 
that (23) does, however, converge]. 
This example illustrates the following theorem, due to Riemann. 
3.54 Theorem Let tan be a ,fleries of real numbers which converges, but not 
absolutely. Suppose 
-00 ~ CX ~ p ~ 00. 
Then there exists a rearrangement ta~ with partial sums s~ such that 
(24) lim inf s~ = ex, lim sups~ = p.

Proof Let 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 77 
Then Pn -qn = an, Pn + qn = I an I, Pn ~ 0, qn ~ 0. The series "'f.pn, "'f.qn 
must both diverge. 
For if both were convergent, then 
would converge, contrary to hypothesis. Since 
N N N N L an = L (Pn -qn) = L Pn -L qn, 
n=1 n=1 n=1 n=1 
divergence of "'f.pn and convergence of "'f.qn ( or vice versa) implies diver&#173;
gence of "'f.an , again contrary to hypothesis. 
Now let P1, P2, P3, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; denote the nonnegative terms of "'f.an, in the 
order in which they occur, and let Q1, Q2, Q3, .&#8226;. be the absolute values 
of the negative terms of "'f.an, also in their original order. 
The series "'f.Pn, "'f.Qn differ from "'f.pn, "'f.qn only by zero terms, and 
are therefore divergent. 
We shall construct sequences {mn}, {kn}, such that the series 
(25) P1 + &#183;&#8226;&#183; +P,,,1 -Q1 -&#183;&#183;&#183; -Qk1 +Pm1+1 + &#183;&#183;&#183; 
+Pm2 -Qk1+1 -&#183;&#183;&#8226; -Qk2 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;, 
which clearly is a rearrangement of "'f.an, satisfies (24). 
Choose real-valued sequences {C&lt;n}, {/3n} such that C&lt;n---+ C&lt;, /3n---+ /3, 
an &lt; Pn, /31 &gt; o. 
Let m1, k1 be the smallest integers such that 
P1 + &#183;&#183;&#183; +Pm1 &gt; /31, 
P1 + &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; + P m1 -Ql -&#8226; &#8226; &#8226; -Qk1 &lt; C(l; 
let m2, k2 be the smallest integers such that 
P1 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +Pm1 -Q1 -&#8226;&#183;&#8226; -Qk1 +P,,,1+1 + &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; +Pm2 &gt; /32,

-... -Qk2 &lt; C&lt;2; 
and continue in this way. This is possible since "'f.Pn and "'f.Qn diverge. 
If xn, Yn denote the partial sums of (25) whose last terms are Pm", 
-Qkn, then 
Since Pn---+ 0 and Qn---+ 0 as n---+ oo, we see that Xn---+ /3, Yn---+ C(. 
Finally, it is clear that no number less than C&lt; or greater than /3 can 
be a subsequential limit of the partial sums of (25). 78 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
3.SS Theorem lf"f.an is a series of complex numbers which converges absolutely,

Now choose p such that the integers 1, 2, ... , N are all contained in the 
set k1, k2, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , kP (we use the notation of Definition 3.52). Then if n &gt; p, 
the numbers a1, ... , aN will cancel in the difference sn -s~, so that 
I sn -s~ I ~ e, by (26). Hence {s~} converges to the same sum as {sn}.
