3.28 so that Sn~ a1 + (a2 + a3) + &#183; &#183; &#183; + (a2k + &#183; &#183; &#183; + a2k+1-1)

On the other hand, if n &gt; 2k, 
so that Sn ~ a1 + a2 + (a3 + a4) + &#183; &#183; &#183; + (a2k-1 + 1 + &#183; &#183; &#183; + a2k) 
~ &#189;a1 + a2 + 2a4 + &#183; &#183; &#183; + 2k-1a2k 
= &#189;tk, 
2Sn ~ fk. 
By (8) and (9), the sequences {sn} and {tk} are either both bounded 
or both unbounded. This completes the proof. 
I Theorem I -converges if p &gt; 1 and diverges if p ~ 1. nP 
Proof If p ~ 0, divergence follows from Theorem 3.23. If p &gt; 0, 
Theorem 3.27 is applicable, and we are led to the series 
C() 1 C() '&#176;' 2k. __ '&#176;' 2(1-p)k 
L.., 2kp -L.., . 
k=O k=O 
Now, 21-p &lt; 1 if and only if 1 -p &lt; 0, and the result follows by com&#173;
parison with the geometric series (take x = 21-P in Theorem 3.26). 
As a further application of Theorem 3.27, we prove: 
3.29 Theorem If p &gt; 1, 
C() 1 
n~2 n(lo 
converges,&#183; if p ~ 1, the series diverges. (10) 
Remark ''log n'' denotes the logarithm of n to the base e (compare Exercise 7, 
Chap. 1); the number e will be defined in a moment (see Definition 3.30). We 
let the series start with n = 2, since log 1 = 0. (11) 
(12) NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 63 
Proof The monotonicity of the logarithmic function (which will be 
discussed in more detail in Chap. 8) implies that {log n} increases. Hence 
{1/n log n} decreases, and we can apply Theorem 3.27 to (10); this 
leads us to the series 
00 1 00 1 1 001 L2k. ___ z:-----z:-
k= 1 2k(log 2k)P -k= 1 (k log 2)P -(log 2)P k= 1 kP' 
and Theorem 3.29 follows from Theorem 3.28. 
This procedure may evidently be continued. For instance, 
00 1 
n~3 n log n log log n 
diverges, whereas 
(13) 00 1 
n~3 n log n(log log n)2 
converges. 
We may now observe that the terms of the series (12) differ very little 
from those of (13). Still, one diverges, the other converges. If we continue the 
process which led us from Theorem 3.28 to Theorem 3.29, and then to (12) and 
(13), we get pairs of convergent and divergent series whose terms differ even 
less than those of (12) and (13). One might thus be led to the conjectt1re that 
there is a limiting situation of some sort, a ''boundary'' with all convergent 
series on one side, all divergent series on the other side:-at least as far as series 
with monotonic coefficients are concerned. This notion of ''boundary'' is of 
course quite vague. The point we wish to make is this: No matter how we make 
this notion precise, the conjecture is false. Exercises 11 (b) and 12(b) may serve 
as illustrations. 
We do not wish to go any deeper into this aspect of convergence theory, 
and refer the reader to Knopp's ''Theory and Application of Infinite Series," 
Chap. IX, particularly Sec. 41. 
THE NUMBER e 
3.30 Definition e = I; 1 . 
n=on! 
Here n ! = 1 &#183; 2 &#183; 3 &#183; &#183; &#183; n if n ~ 1, and O ! = 1. 64 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Since

the series converges, and the definition makes sense. In fact, the series converges 
very rapidly and allows us to compute e with great accuracy. 
It is of interest to note that e can also be defined by means of another 
limit process; the proof provides a good illustration of operations with limits: 
3.31 Theorem lim 
Proof Let 1 n 
1 + -= e. n 
n 1 
Sn= L kl, 
k=O &#8226; 
By the binomial theorem,

tn = l + 1 + 1 2. 1 1 1--+&#173;n 3! 
Hence tn ~Sn' so that 1 1 - -n 1 n 
t = l+-&#183; n

1 1 +-1--n! n 2 1 - -n 
(14) lim sup tn ~ e, 
n&#10132;oo 
by Theorem 3.19. Next, if n ~ m, n-1 ... 1---
n

tn ~ 1 + 1 + 2 1 1-&#173;n 1 + ... +-1 1-&#173;n m-1 ... 1--- &#8226; ml n 
Let n &#10132; oo, keeping m fixed. We get 
1 
n&#10132;oo 
so that 
n-+ oo 
Letting m &gt; oo, we finally get 
(15) e ~ lim inf tn. 
n-+ oo 
The theorem follows from (14) and (15). &#8226; NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 65 
The rapidity with which the series L 1 converges can be estimated as n! 
follows: If sn has the same meaning as above, we have 
1 1 1 e-s =---+---+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; n (n + 1) ! (n + 2) ! (n + 3) ! 
1 1 1 1 &lt;---1+--+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; =-(n + 1) ! n + 1 (n + 1)2 n !n 
so that 
(16) 1 
0 &lt; e-s &lt; -&#183; 
n n!n 
Thus s10, for instance, approximates e with an error less than 10-1. The 
inequality (16) is of theoretical interest as well, since it enables us to prove the 
irrationality of e very easily. 
3.32 Theorem e is irrational. 
(17) Proof Suppose e is rational. Then e = p/q, where p and q are positive 
integers. By (16), 
1 0 &lt;q!(e-sq) &lt;-&#183; q 
By our assumption, q!e is an integer. Since 
q!sq = q! 1 1 l+l+-+&#183;&#183;&#183;+-2 ! q! 
is an integer, we see that q!(e -sq) is an integer. 
Since q ~ l, (17) implies the existence of an integer between O and 1. 
We have thus reached a contradiction. 
Actually, e is not even an algebraic number. For a simple proof of this, 
see page 25 of Niven's book, or page 176 of Herstein's, cited in the Bibliography.

Theorem 3.2(c) and example (d) of Definition 3.1 show that convergent 
sequences are bounded, but that bounded sequences in Rk need not converge. 
However, there is one important case in which convergence is equivalent to 
boundedness; this happens for monotonic sequences in R1&#8226; 
3.13 Definition A sequence {sn} of real numbers is said to be 
(a) monotonically increasing if Sn~ Sn+l (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ); 
(b) monotonically decreasing if Sn~ Sn+i (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
The class of monotonic sequences consists of the increasing and the 
decreasing sequences. 
3.14 Theorem Suppose {sn} is monotonic. Then {sn} converges if and only if it 
is bounded. 
Proof Suppose Sn~ Sn+i (the proof is analogous in the other case). 
Let E be the range of {sn}. If {sn} is bounded, let s be the least upper 
bound of E. Then 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
For every B &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that 
for otherwise s -s would be an upper bound of E. Since {sn} increases, 
n ~ N the ref ore implies 
s -e &lt;Sn~ s, 
which shows that {sn} converges (to s). 
The converse follows from Theorem 3.2(c). 
UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS 
3.15 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers with the following 
property: For every real 1\1 there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M. We then write 
Sn&#10132;+OO. 
Similarly, if for every real M there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M, we write 
Sn &#9658; -00. 56 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
It should be noted that we now use the symbol &#10132; (introduced in Defini&#173;
tion 3.1) for certain types of divergent sequences, as well as for convergent 
sequences, but that the definitions of convergence and of limit, given in Defini&#173;
tion 3.1, are in no way changed. 
3.16 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers. Let Ebe the set of 
numbers x (in the extended real number system) such that sn,. ) x for some 
subsequence {j'n,.}. This set E contains all subsequential limits as defined in 
Definition 3.5, plus possibly the numbers + oo, -oo. 
We now recall Definitions 1.8 and 1.23 and put 
s* = sup E, 
s* = inf E. 
The numbers s*, s* are called the upper and lower limits of {sn}; we use the 
notation 
lim sup Sn= s*, lim inf Sn = s*. 
n&#10132;oo ft&#10132; 00 
3.17 Theorem Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers. Let E ands* have the 
same meaning as in Definition 3.16. Thens* has the following two properties: 
(a) s* e E. 
(b) If x &gt; s*, there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies Sn &lt; x. 
Moreover, s* is the only number with the properties (a) and (b). 
Of course, an analogous result is true for s*. 
Proof 
(a) Ifs* = + oo, then Eis not bounded above; hence {sn} is not bounded 
above, and there is a subsequence {sn,.} such that sn,. ) + oo. 
Ifs* is real, then Eis bounded above, and at least one subsequential 
limit exists, so that (a) follows from Theorems 3.7 and 2.28. 
If s* = -oo, then E contains only one element, namely -oo, and 
there is no subsequential limit. Hence, for any real M, Sn &gt; M for at 
most a finite number of values of n, so that sn ) -oo. 
This establishes (a) in all cases. 
(b) Suppose there is a number x &gt; s* such that Sn ~ x for infinitely 
many values of n. In that case, there is a number ye E such that 
y ~ x &gt; s*, contradicting the definition of s*. 
Thuss* satisfies (a) and (b). 
To show the uniqueness, suppose there are two numbers, p and q, 
which satisfy (a) and (b), and suppose p &lt; q. Choose x such thatp &lt; x &lt; q. 
Since p satisfies (b), we have sn &lt; x for n ~ N. But then q cannot satisfy (a). NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 57 
3.18 &#183; Examples 
(a) Let {sn} be a sequence containing all rationals. Then every real 
number is a subsequential limit, and 
lim sup Sn= + 00, 
ft&#10132;OO 
(b) Let s,1 = ( -1 ") /[1 + (1/n)]. Then 
lim sup Sn= 1, 
n&#10132; oo lim inf Sn= -oo. 
ft&#10132;OO 
lim inf Sn = -1. 
ft&#10132;OO 
(c) For a real-valued sequence {sn}, lim sn = s if and only if 
lim sup Sn= lim inf Sn= s. 
ft&#10132; 00 ft&#10132; 00 
We close this section with a theorem which is useful, and whose proof is 
quite trivial: 
3.19 Theorem If Sn ~ tn for n ~ N, where N is fixed, then 
lim inf Sn ~ lim inf tn, 
lim sup Sn ~ lim sup tn. 
ft&#10132; 00 ft&#10132; 00 
SOME SPECIAL SEQUENCES 
We shall now compute the limits of some sequences which occur frequently. 
The proofs will all be based on the following remark: If O ~ Xn ~ sn for n ~ N, 
where N is some fixed number, and if Sn&#10132; 0, then Xn &#10132; 0.

Proof 
(a) Take n &gt; (1/s)11P. (Note that the archimedean property of the real 
number system is used here.) 
(b) If p &gt; 1, put Xn = ::jp -1. Then Xn &gt; 0, and, by the binomial 
theorem, 
so that

Hence xn &#10132; 0. If p = 1, (b) is trivial, and if O &lt; p &lt; 1, the result is obtained 
by taking reciprocals.

SERIES 
In the remainder of this chapter, all sequences and series under consideration 
will be complex-valued, unless the contrary is explicitly stated. Extensions of 
some of the theorems which follow, to series with terms in Rk, are mentioned 
in Exercise 15. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SER.IES 59 
3.21 Definition Given a sequence {an}, we use the notation 
n=p 
to denote the sum aP + ap+l + &#183; &#183; &#183; + aq. With {an} we associate a sequence 
{sn}, where 
For {sn} we also use the symbolic expression 
a1 + a2 + a3 + ... 
or, more concisely, 
00 
(4) Lan. 
n=l 
The symbol (4) we call an in.finite series, or just a series. The numbers 
Sn are called the partial sums of the series. If {sn} converges to s, we say that 
the series converges, and write 
00 
Lan= s. 
n= 1 
The number s is called the sum of the series; but it should be clearly under&#173;
stood that s is the limit of a sequence of sums, and is not obtained simply by 
addition. 
If {sn} diverges, the series is said to diverge. 
Sometimes, for convenience of notation, we shall consider series of the 
form 
00 
(5) Lan. 
n=O 
And frequently, when there is no possible ambiguity, or when the distinction 
is immaterial, we shall simply write :I:an in place of (4) or (5). 
It is clear that every theorem about sequences can be stated in terms of 
series (putting a1 = s1, and an = Sn -Sn -i for n &gt; 1 ), and vice versa. But it is 
nevertheless useful to consider both concepts. 
The Cauchy criterion (Theorem 3.11) can be restated in the following 
form: 
3.22 Theorem :I:an converges if and only if for every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that

If{pn} is a sequence in X and if EN consists of the points PN, PN+ 1,PN+2, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , 
it is clear from the two preceding definitions that {Pn} is a Cauc/1y sequence 
if and only if 
lim diam EN= 0. 
N-+oo 
3.10 Theorem 
(a) If E is the closure of a set E in a metric space X, then 
diam E = diam E. 
(b) If Kn is a sequence of compact sets in X such that Kn::::, Kn+i 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) and if 
lim diam Kn= 0, 
n&#10132;oo 
then n '? Kn consists of exactly one point. 
Proof 
(a) Since E c E, it is clear that 
diam E::; diam E. 
Fix a &gt; 0, and choose p E E, q E &#163;. By the definition of E, there are 
points p', q', in E such that d(p, p') &lt; s, d(q, q') &lt; B. Hence 
d(p, q) ::; d(p, p') + d(p' q') + d(q', q) 
&lt; 2s + d(p', q') ~ 2s -+ diam E. 
It follows that 
diam E ~ 2s + diam E, 
and since e was arbitrary, (a) is proved. 
(b) Put K = n '?Kn. By Theorem 2.36, K is not empty. If K contains 
more than one point, then diam K &gt; 0. But for each n, Kn ::::, K, so that 
diam Kn ~ diam K. This contradicts the assumption that diam Kn ---+ 0. 
3.11 Theorem 
(a) In any metric space X, every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. 
(b) If Xis a compact metric space and if {Pn} is a Cauchy sequence in X, 
then {pn} converges to some point of X. 
(c) In Rk, every Cauchy sequence converges. 
Note: The difference between the definition of convergence and 
the definition of a Cauchy sequence is that the limit is explicitly involved 
in the former, but not in the latter. Thus Theorem 3.11 (b) may enable us 54 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
(3) to decide whether or not a given sequence converges without knowledge 
of the limit to which it may converge. 
The fact (contained in Theorem 3.11) that a sequence converges in 
Rk if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence is usually called the Cauchy 
criterion for convergence. 
Proof 
(a) If Pn &#10132; p and if e &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that d(p, Pn) &lt; e 
for all n ~ N. Hence 
d(pn, p,,.) ~ d(pn, p) + d(p, Pm) &lt; 2B 
as soon as n ~ N and m ~ N. Thus {pn} is a Cauchy sequence. 
(b) Let {Pn} be a Cauchy sequence in the compact space X. For 
N = 1, 2, 3, ... , let EN be the set consisting of PN, PN+t, PN+2, .... 
Then 
lim diam EN= 0, 
N&#10132;oo 
by Definition 3.9 and Theorem 3. lO(a). Being a closed subset of the 
compact space X, each EN is compact (Theorem 2.35). Also EN:::&gt; EN+i, 
so that EN=&gt; EN+1&#8226; 
Theorem 3.lO(b) shows now that there is a unique p EX which lies 
in every EN. 
Let e &gt; 0 be given. By (3) there is an integer NO such that 
diam EN &lt; e if N ~ N0&#8226; Since p E EN, it follows that d(p, q) &lt; B for 
every q E EN, hence for every q E EN. In other words, d(p, Pn) &lt; e if 
n ~ NO &#8226; This says precisely that Pn &#8226; p. 
(c) Let {xn} be a Cauchy sequence in Rk. Define EN as in (b), with x, 
in place of Pi. For some N, diam EN&lt; 1. The range of {xn} is the union 
of EN and the finite set {x1, ... , xN-1}. Hence {xn} is bounded. Since 
every bounded subset of Rk has compact closure in Rk (Theorem 2.41), 
(c) follows from (b). 
3.12 Definition A metric space in which every Cauchy sequence converges is 
said to be complete. 
Thus Theorem 3.11 says that all compact metric spaces and all Euclidean 
spaces are complete. Theorem 3.11 implies also that every closed subset E of&#183; a 
complete metric space Xis complete. (Every Cauchy sequence in Eis a Cauchy 
sequence in X, hence it converges to some p EX, and actually p e E since Eis 
closed.) An example of a metric space which is not complete is the space of all 
rational numbers, with d(x, y) = Ix -YI. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 55 
Theorem 3.2(c) and example (d) of Definition 3.1 show that convergent 
sequences are bounded, but that bounded sequences in Rk need not converge. 
However, there is one important case in which convergence is equivalent to 
boundedness; this happens for monotonic sequences in R1&#8226; 
3.13 Definition A sequence {sn} of real numbers is said to be 
(a) monotonically increasing if Sn~ Sn+l (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ); 
(b) monotonically decreasing if Sn~ Sn+i (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
The class of monotonic sequences consists of the increasing and the 
decreasing sequences. 
3.14 Theorem Suppose {sn} is monotonic. Then {sn} converges if and only if it 
is bounded. 
Proof Suppose Sn~ Sn+i (the proof is analogous in the other case). 
Let E be the range of {sn}. If {sn} is bounded, let s be the least upper 
bound of E. Then 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
For every B &gt; 0, there is an integer N such that 
for otherwise s -s would be an upper bound of E. Since {sn} increases, 
n ~ N the ref ore implies 
s -e &lt;Sn~ s, 
which shows that {sn} converges (to s). 
The converse follows from Theorem 3.2(c).

3.15 Definition Let {sn} be a sequence of real numbers with the following 
property: For every real 1\1 there is an integer N such that n ~ N implies 
sn ~ M. We then write 
Sn&#10132;+OO.

It might be well to point out that our definition of ''convergent sequence'' 
depends not only on {Pn} but also on X; for instance, the sequence {1/n} con&#173;
verges in R1 (to 0), but fails to converge in the set of all positive real numbers 
[with d(x, y) = Ix -y I]. In cases of possible ambiguity, we can be more 
precise and specify ''convergent in X'' rather than ''convergent." 
We recall that the set of all points Pn (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) is the range of {Pn}. 
The range of a sequence may be a finite set, or it may be infinite. The sequence 
{p n} is said to be bounded if its range is bounded. 
As examples, consider the following sequences of complex numbers 
(that is, X = R2): 
(a) If sn = 1/n, then limn-+oo sn = O; the range is infinite, and the sequence 
is bounded. 
(b) If sn = n2, the sequence {sn} is unbounded, is divergent, and has 
infinite range. 
(c) If sn = 1 + [( -l)n/n], the sequence {sn} converges to I, is bounded, 
and has infinite range. 
(d) If sn = in, the sequence {sn} is divergent, is bounded, and has finite 
range. 
(e) If sn = 1 (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), then {sn} converges to 1, is bounded, and 
&#8226; 
has finite range. 
We now summarize some important properties of convergent sequences 
in metric spaces. 
3.2 Theorem Let {p n} be a sequence in a metric space X. 
(a) {Pn} converges to p e X if and only if every neighborhood o.f p contains 
Pn for all but finitely many n. 
(b) If p e X, p' e X, and if {Pn} converges top and top', then p' = p. 
(c) If {Pn} converges, then {Pn} is bounded. 
(d) If E c X and if p is a limit point of E, then there is a sequence {Pn} in E 
such that p = lim Pn . 
n-+ oo 
Proof (a) Suppose Pn &#10132; p and let V be a neighborhood of p. For 
some e &gt; 0, the conditions d(q, p) &lt; e, q e X imply q e V. Correspond&#173;
ing to this e, there exists N such that n ~ N implies d(p n, p) &lt; e. Thus 
n ~ N implies Pn E V. 
Conversely, suppose every neighborhood of p contains all but 
finitely many of the Pn. Fix e &gt; 0, and let V be the set of all q e X such 
that d(p, q) &lt; e. By assumption, there exists N (corresponding to this V) 
such that Pn E V if n ~ N. Thus d(pn, p) &lt; e if n ~ N; hence Pn &gt; p. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 49 
(b) Let e &gt; 0 be given. There exist integers N, N' such that 
n~N implies 
n ~ N' implies 
Hence if n ~ max (N, N'), we have 
d(p, p') ~ d(p, Pn) + d(pn, p') &lt; e. 
Since e was arbitrary, we conclude that d(p, p') = 0. 
(c) Suppose Pn &#8226; p. There is an integer N such that n &gt; N 
implies d(pn, p) &lt; 1. Put 
r = max {l, d(p1, p), ... , d(pN, p)}. 
Then d(pn,P) ~ r for n = 1, 2, 3, .... 
(d) For each positive integer n, there is a point Pn e E such that 
d(pn, p) &lt; 1/n. Given e &gt; 0, choose N so that Ne&gt; 1. If n &gt; N, it 
follows that d(pn, p) &lt; e. Hence Pn &gt; p. 
This completes the proof. 
For sequences in Rk we can study the relation between convergence, on 
the one hand, and the algebraic operations on the other. We first consider 
sequences of complex numbers.

(a) Given e &gt; 0, there exist integers N1, N2 such that 
n ~ N 1 implies

(1) If N = max (N1, N2), then n ~ N implies 
I (sn + tn) -(s + t) I ~ I Sn -SI + I tn -t I &lt; B. 
This proves (a). The proof of (b) is trivial. 
(c) We use the identity 
Sntn -st = (sn -s)(tn -t) + s(tn -t) + t(sn -s). 
Given e &gt; 0, there are integers N1, N2 such that 
n ~ N1 implies lsn -sl &lt; J;, 
n ~ N2 implies I tn -ti &lt; J;. 
If we take N = max (N1, N2), n ~ N implies 
I (sn -s)(tn -t)I &lt; B, 
so that 
lim (sn -s)(tn -t) = 0.

We now apply (a) and (b) to (1), and conclude that

sequence of {Pn} converges to a point of X. 
(b) Every bounded sequence in Rk contains a convergent subsequence. 52 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Proof 
(a) Let Ebe the range of {Pn}. If Eis finite then there is ape E and a

P -p -&#183;&#183;&#183;-p n, -na --&#8226; 
The subsequence {Pn1} so obtained converges evidently to p. 
If E is infinite, Theorem 2.37 shows that E has a limit point p e X. 
Choose n1 so that d(P,Pn1) &lt; 1. Having chosen n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1, we see from 
Theorem 2.20 that there is an integer n1 &gt; n1_1 such that d(P,Pn,) &lt; 1/i.

3.7 Theorem The subsequential limits of a sequence {Pn} in a metric space X 
form a closed subset of X. 
Proof Let E* be the set of all subsequential limits of {Pn} and let q be a 
limit point of E*. We have to show that q e E*. 
Choose n1 so that Pn1 =I= q. (If no such n1 exists, then E* has only 
one point, and there is nothing to prove.) Put ~ = d(q, Pn1). Suppose 
n1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , n1_1 are chosen. Since q is a limit point of E*, there is an x e E* 
with d(x, q) &lt; 2-1
~. Since x e E*, there is an n1 &gt; n1_1 such that 
d(x,Pn,) &lt; 2-1~. Thus 
d(q, Pn,) ~ 21-1~ 
for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . . This says that {Pn,} converges to q. Hence q e E*.

(a) If E is the closure of a set E in a metric space X, then

(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) and if 
lim diam Kn= 0, 
n&#10132;oo 
then n '? Kn consists of exactly one point. 
Proof 
(a) Since E c E, it is clear that 
diam E::; diam E. 
Fix a &gt; 0, and choose p E E, q E &#163;. By the definition of E, there are 
points p', q', in E such that d(p, p') &lt; s, d(q, q') &lt; B. Hence 
d(p, q) ::; d(p, p') + d(p' q') + d(q', q) 
&lt; 2s + d(p', q') ~ 2s -+ diam E. 
It follows that 
diam E ~ 2s + diam E, 
and since e was arbitrary, (a) is proved. 
(b) Put K = n '?Kn. By Theorem 2.36, K is not empty. If K contains 
more than one point, then diam K &gt; 0. But for each n, Kn ::::, K, so that

2.18 Definition Let X be a metric space. All points and sets mentioned below 
are understood to be elements and subsets of X. 
(a) A neighborhood of p is a set N,(p) consisting of all q such that 
d(p, q) &lt; r, for some r &gt; 0, The number r is called the radius of N,(p). 
(b) A point p is a limit point of the set E if every neighborhood of p 
contains a point q &#165;= p such that q e &#163;. 
(c) If p e E and p is not a limit point of E, then p is called an isolated 
point of E. 
(d) Eis closed if every limit point of Eis a point of E. 
(e) A point p is an interior point of E if there is a neighborhood N of p 
such that N c: E. 
(f) E is open if every point of E is an interior point of E. 
(g) The complement of E (denoted by Ee) is the set of all points p e X 
such that p &#162; E. 
(h) E is perfect if E is closed and if every point of E is a limit point 
of E. 
(i) Eis bounded if there is a real number Mand a point q e X such that 
d(p, q) &lt; M for all p e E. 
(j) E is dense in X if every point of X is a limit point of E, or a point of 
E (or both). 
Let us note that in R1 neighborhoods are segments, whereas in R2 neigh&#173;
borhoods are interiors of circles. 
2.19 Theorem Every neighborhood is an open set. 
Proof Consider a neighborhood E = N,(p), and let q be any point of E. 
Then there is a positive real number h such that 
d(p, q) = r -h. 
For all points s such that d(q, s) &lt; h, we have then 
d(p, s):::;; d(p, q) + d(q, s) &lt; r -h + h = r, 
so that s e E. Thus q is an interior point of E. 
2.20 Theorem If p is a limit point of a set E, then every neighborhood of p 
contains infinitely many points of E. 
Proof Suppose there is a neighborhood N of p which contains only a 
finite number of points of E. Let q1, &#8226;.. , qn be those points of N n E, 
which are distinct from p, and put 
r = min d(p, qm) 
1:Sm:Sn BASIC TOPOLOGY 33 
[we use this notation to denote the smallest of the numbers d(p, q1), &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , 
d(p, qn)J. The minimum of a finite set of positive numbers is clearly posi&#173;
tive, so that r &gt; 0. 
The neighborhood Nr(P) contains no point q of E such that q ~ p, 
so that p is not a limit point of E. This contradiction establishes the 
theorem. 
Corollary A finite point set has no limit points. 
2.21 Examples Let us consider the following subsets of R2: 
(a) The set of all complex z such that I z I &lt; 1. 
(b) The set of all complex z such that I z I s; I. 
(c) A nonempty finite set. 
(d) The set of all integers. 
(e) The set consisting of the numbers 1/n (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). Let us note 
that this set E has a limit point (namely, z = 0) but that no point of E is 
a limit point of E; we wish to stress the difference between having a limit 
point and containing one. 
(f) The set of all complex numbers (that is, R2). 
(g) The segment (a, b). 
Let us note that (d), (e), (g) can be regarded also as subsets of R1&#8226; 
Some properties of these sets are tabulated below:

(d) Yes No No No 
(e) No No No Yes

(a, b) is not open ifwe regard it as a subset of R2, but it is an open subset of R1&#8226;

(20)

X &#162; u. E.' hence X ' E. for any IX, hence Xe E: for every IX, so that X en E!. 
Thus Ac: B. 34 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
Conversely, if x e B, then x e E! for every IX, hence x &#162;Ea.for any IX, 
hence x &#162; U. E., so that x e ( U11 E.)c. Thus B c A. 
It follows that A = B. 
2.23 Theorem A set E is open if and only if its complement is closed. 
Proof First, suppose Ee is closed. Choose x e E. Then x &#162; Ee, and xis 
not a limit point of Ee. Hence there exists a neighborhood N of x such 
that Ee r. N is empty, that is, N c E. Thus x is an interior point of E, 
and E is open. 
Next, suppose E is open. Let x be a limit point of Ee. Then every 
neighborhood of x contains a point of Ee, so that x is not an interior point 
of E. Since E is open, this means that x e Ee. It follows that Ee is closed. 
Corollary A set Fis closed if and only if its complement is open. 
2.24 Theorem 
(21) (a) For any collection {G.} of open sets, U. G. is open. 
(b) For any collection {F.} of closed sets, n. F. is closed. 
(c) For any finite collection G1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , Gn of open sets, ni= 1 Gi is open. 
(d) For any finite collection F1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , Fn of closed sets, Ui = 1 F, is closed. 
Proof Put G = U. G.. If x e G, then x e G. for some IX. Since x is an 
interior point of G., x is also an interior point of G, and G is open. This 
proves (a). 
By Theorem 2.22, 
and F! is open, by Theorem 2.23. Hence (a) implies that (21) is open so 
that n/A F. is closed. 
Next, put H = n;= 1 G,. For any x e H, there exist neighborhoods 
N, of x, with radii r,, such that N, c G, (i = 1, ... , n). Put 
r = min (r1, &#8226;&#8226;. , rn), 
and let N be the neighborhood of x of radius r. Then N c G, for i = 1, 
... , n, so that N c H, and His open. 
By taking complements, (d) follows from (c): BASIC TOPOLOGY 35 
2.25 Examples In parts (c) and (d) of the preceding theorem, the finiteness of 
the collections is essential. For let Gn be the segment -! , ! (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). n n 
Then Gn is an open subset of R1&#8226; Put G = ():-'= 1 Gn. Then G consists of a single 
point (namely, x = 0) and is therefore not an open subset of R1&#8226; 
Thus the intersection of an infinite collection of open sets need not be open. 
Similarly, the union of an infinite collection of closed sets need not be closed. 
2.26 Definition If X is a metric space, if E c: X, and if E' denotes the set of 
all limit points of E in X, then the closure of E is the set E = E u E'. 
2.27 Theorem If Xis a metric space and E c: X, then 
(a) Eis closed, 
(b) E = E if and only if Eis closed, 
(c) E c: F for every closed set F c: X such that E c: F. 
By (a) and (c), E Is the smallest closed subset of X that contains E. 
Proof 
(a) If p e X and p &#162; E then p is neither a point of E nor a limit point of E. 
Hence p has a neighborhood which does not intersect E. The complement 
of E is the ref ore open. Hence E is closed. 
(b) If E = E, (a) implies that Eis closed. If Eis closed, then E' c: E 
[by Definitions 2.18(d) and 2.26], hence E = E. 
( c) If F is closed and F =:J E, then F =:J F', hence F =:J E'. Thus F =:J E. 
2.28 Theorem Let Ebe a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above. 
Let y = sup E. Then y e E. Hence y e E if Eis closed. 
Compare this with the examples in Sec. 1.9. 
Proof If y e E then y e E. Assume y &#162; E. For every h &gt; 0 there exists 
then a point x e E such that y -h &lt; x &lt; y, for otherwise y -h would be 
an upper bound of E. Thus y is a limit point of E. Hence ye E. 
2.29 Remark Suppose E c Y c: X, where Xis a metric space. To say that E 
is an open subset of X means that to each point p e E there is associated a 
positive number r such that the conditions d(p, q) &lt; r, q e X imply that q e E. 
But we have already observed (Sec. 2.16) that Y is also a metric space, so that 
our definitions may equally well be made within Y. To be quite explicit, let us 
say that E is open relative to Y if to each p e E there is associated an r &gt; 0 such 
that q e E whenever d(p, q) &lt; r and q e Y. Example 2.21(g) showed that a set 36 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
may be open relative to Y without being an open subset of X. However, there 
is a simple relation between these concepts, which we now state. 
2.30 Theorem Suppose Y c: X. A subset E of Y is open relative to Y if and 
only if E = Y n G for some open subset G of X. 
Proof Suppose Eis open relative to Y. To each p e E there is a positive 
number r P such that the conditions d(p, q) &lt; r P, q e Y imply that q e E. 
Let VP be the set of all q e X such that d(p, q) &lt; rP, and define 
G = u VP. 
peE 
Then G is an open subset of X, by Theorems 2.19 and 2.24. 
Since p e VP for all p e E, it is clear that E c: G n Y. 
By our choice of VP, we have VP n Y c: E for every p e E, so that 
G n Y c: E. Thus E = G n Y, and one half of the theorem is proved. 
Conversely, if G is open in X and E = G n Y, every p e E has a 
neighborhood VP c: G. Then VP n Y c: E, so that Eis open relative to Y. 
COMPACT SETS 
2.31 Definition By an open cover of a set E in a metric space X we mean a 
collection {G11} of open subsets of X such that E c: U11 Ga.. 
2.32 Definition A subset K of a metric space X is said to be compact if every 
open cover of K contains a finite subcover. 
More explicitly, the requirement is that if { G11} is an open cover of K, then 
there are finitely many indices oc1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , &#176;'" such that 
Kc:G u&#183;&#183;&#183;uG &#171;1 IZn " 
The notion of compactness is of great importance in analysis, especially 
in connection with continuity (Chap. 4). 
It is clear that every finite set is compact. The existence of a large class of 
infinite compact sets in Rk will follow from Theorem 2.41. 
We observed earlier (in Sec. 2.29) that if E c: Y c: X, then E may be open 
relative to Y without being open relative to X. The property of being open thus 
depends on the space in which E is embedded. The same is true of the property 
of being closed. 
Compactness, however, behaves better, as we shall now see. To formu&#173;
late the next theorem, let us say, temporarily, that K is compact relative to X if 
the requirements of Definition 2.32 are met. BASIC TOPOLOGY 37 
2.33 Theorem Suppose K c Y c X. Then K is compact relative to X if and 
only if K is compact relative to Y. 
By virtue of this theorem we are able, in many situations, to regard com&#173;
pact sets as metric spaces in their own right, without paying any attention to 
any embedding space. In particular, althot1gh it makes little sense to talk of 
open spaces, or of closed spaces (every metric space Xis an open subset of itself, 
and is a closed subset of itself), it does make sense to talk of compact metric 
spaces. 
(22) 
(23) Proof Suppose K is compact relative to X, and let { Va} be a collection 
of sets, open relative to Y, such that Kc U&#171; Va. By theorem 2.30, there 
are sets Ga, open relative to X, such that Va = Y n G &#171;, for all (X; and since 
K is compact relative to X, we have

K C Va, U &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; U Van&#8226; 
This proves that K is compact relative to Y. 
Conversely, suppose K is compact relative to Y, let { Ga} be a col&#173;
lection of open subsets of X which covers K, and put Va = Y n Ga. Then 
(23) will hold for some choice of ct1, ... , (Xn; and since Va c Ga, (23) 
implies (22). 
This completes the proof. 
2.34 Theorem Compact si,bset.fi of metric spaces are closed. 
Proof Let K be a compact subset of a metric space X. We shall prove 
that the complement of K is an open subset of X. 
Suppose p E X, p &#162; K. If q E K, let Vq and Wq be neighborhoods of p 
and q, respectively, of radius less than }d(p, q) [see Definition 2.18(a)].

Let V1 be any neighborhood of x1&#8226; If V1 consists of all y e Rk such 
that I y -x1 I &lt; r, the closure V1 of V1 is the set of all ye Rk such that 
IY-X1I ~r. 
Suppose Vn has been constructed, so that Vn n Pis not empty. Since 
every point of Pis a limit point of P, there is a neighborhood Vn+i such 
that (i) Yn + 1 C: vn , ( ii) Xn &#162; Yn + 1, (iii) Vn + 1 n p is not empty. By (iii), 
Vn+i satisfies our induction hypothesis, and the construction can proceed. 
Put Kn = Yn n P. Since Yn is closed and bounded, Yn is compact. 
Since Xn &#162; Kn+l, no point of plies in n'? Kn. Since Kn C: P, this implies 
that nf Kn is empty. But each Kn is nonempty, by (iii), and Kn=&gt; Kn+t, 
by (i); this contradicts the Corollary to Theorem 2.36. 
Corollary Every interval [a, b] (a &lt; b) is uncountable. In particular, the set of 
all real numbers is uncountable. 
2.44 The Cantor set The set which we are now going to construct shows 
that there exist perfect sets in R1 which contain no segment. 
Let E0 be the interval [O, l]. Remove the segment (&#189;, f), and let E1 be 
the union of the intervals 
[O, t] [t, 1 ]. 
Remove the middle thirds of these intervals, and let E2 be the union of the 
intervals 
[0, &#189;], [&#190;, &#190;], [t, &#190;], [!, 1]. 
Continuing in this way, we obtain a sequence of compact sets En, such that 
(a) E1 =&gt; E2 =&gt; E3 =&gt; &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ; 
(b) En is the union of 2n intervals, each of length 3-n. 
The set 
00 
P= n En 
n= 1 
is called the Cantor set. Pis clearly compact, and Theorem 2.36 shows that P 
is not empty. 42 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
No segment of the form 
(24) ' 
where k and m are positive integers, has a point in common with P. Since every 
segment (ix, /3) contains a segment of the form (24), if 
P contains no segment. 3-m f3 -IX 
&lt; 6 ' 
To show that Pis perfect, it is enough to show that P contains no isolated 
point. Let x e P, and let S be any segment containing x. Let In be that interval 
of En which contains x. Choose n large enough, so that In c S. Let Xn be an 
endpoint of In, such that Xn :#: x. 
It follows from the construction of P that Xn e P. Hence xis a limit point 
of P, and P is perfect. 
One of the most interesting properties of the Cantor set is that it provides 
us with an example of an uncountable set of measure zero (the concept of 
measure will be discussed in Chap. 11). 
CONNECTED SETS 
2.45 Definition Two subsets A and B of a metric space X are said to be 
separated if both A n Band An Bare empty, i.e., if no point of A lies in the 
closure of Band no point of B lies in the closure of A. 
A set E c X is said to be connected if E is not a union of two nonempty 
separated sets. 
2.46 Remark Separated sets are of course disjoint, but disjoint sets need not 
be separated. For example, the interval [O, 1] and the segment (1, 2) are not 
separated, since 1 is a limit point of (1, 2). However, the segments (0, 1) and 
(1, 2) are separated. 
The connected subsets of the line have a particularly simple structure: 
2.47 Theorem A subset E of the real line R1 is connected if and only if it has the 
following property: If x e &#163;,ye&#163;, and x &lt; z &lt; y, then z e &#163;. I 
Proof If there exist x e &#163;,ye&#163;, and some z e (x, y) such that z &#162; E, then

As the title indicates, this chapter will deal primarily with sequences and series 
of complex numbers. The basic facts about convergence, however, are just as 
easily explained in a more general setting. The first three sections will the ref ore 
be concerned with sequences in euclidean spaces, or even in metric spaces. 
CONVERGENT SEQUENCES 
3.1 Definition A sequence {Pn} in a metric space Xis said to converge if there 
is a point p e X with the following property: For every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that n ~ N implies that d(pn, p) &lt; e. (Here d denotes the distance in X.) 
In this case we also say that {Pn} converges to p, or that p is the limit of 
{Pn} [see Theorem 3.2(b)], and we write Pn &#10132; p, or 
lim Pn = p. 
n&#10132;oo 
If {Pn} does not converge, it is said to diverge. 48 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
It might be well to point out that our definition of ''convergent sequence'' 
depends not only on {Pn} but also on X; for instance, the sequence {1/n} con&#173;
verges in R1 (to 0), but fails to converge in the set of all positive real numbers 
[with d(x, y) = Ix -y I]. In cases of possible ambiguity, we can be more 
precise and specify ''convergent in X'' rather than ''convergent." 
We recall that the set of all points Pn (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ) is the range of {Pn}. 
The range of a sequence may be a finite set, or it may be infinite. The sequence 
{p n} is said to be bounded if its range is bounded. 
As examples, consider the following sequences of complex numbers 
(that is, X = R2): 
(a) If sn = 1/n, then limn-+oo sn = O; the range is infinite, and the sequence 
is bounded. 
(b) If sn = n2, the sequence {sn} is unbounded, is divergent, and has 
infinite range. 
(c) If sn = 1 + [( -l)n/n], the sequence {sn} converges to I, is bounded, 
and has infinite range. 
(d) If sn = in, the sequence {sn} is divergent, is bounded, and has finite 
range. 
(e) If sn = 1 (n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), then {sn} converges to 1, is bounded, and 
&#8226; 
has finite range. 
We now summarize some important properties of convergent sequences 
in metric spaces. 
3.2 Theorem Let {p n} be a sequence in a metric space X. 
(a) {Pn} converges to p e X if and only if every neighborhood o.f p contains 
Pn for all but finitely many n. 
(b) If p e X, p' e X, and if {Pn} converges top and top', then p' = p. 
(c) If {Pn} converges, then {Pn} is bounded. 
(d) If E c X and if p is a limit point of E, then there is a sequence {Pn} in E 
such that p = lim Pn . 
n-+ oo 
Proof (a) Suppose Pn &#10132; p and let V be a neighborhood of p. For 
some e &gt; 0, the conditions d(q, p) &lt; e, q e X imply q e V. Correspond&#173;
ing to this e, there exists N such that n ~ N implies d(p n, p) &lt; e. Thus 
n ~ N implies Pn E V. 
Conversely, suppose every neighborhood of p contains all but 
finitely many of the Pn. Fix e &gt; 0, and let V be the set of all q e X such 
that d(p, q) &lt; e. By assumption, there exists N (corresponding to this V) 
such that Pn E V if n ~ N. Thus d(pn, p) &lt; e if n ~ N; hence Pn &gt; p. </description></item><item><title>11 Absolute Convergence</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/11_Absolute_Convergence.pdf</link><description>60 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
In particular, by taking m = n, (6) becomes 
I an I ~ B (n ~ N). 
In other words: 
3.23 Theorem lf :I:an converges, then limn&#10132;oo an = 0. 
The condition an&#10132; 0 is not, however, sufficient to ensure convergence 
of :I:an. For instance, the series 
CX) 1 I -
n= 1 n 
diverges; for the proof we refer to Theorem 3.28. 
Theorem 3.14, concerning monotonic sequences, also has an immediate 
counterpart for series. 
3.24 Theorem A series of nonnegative1 terms converges if and only if its 
partial sums form a bounded sequence. 
We now tum to a convergence test of a different nature, the so-called 
''comparison test." 
3.25 Theorem 
(a) If I an I ~ Cn for n ~ N0, where N0 is some fixed integer, and if :I:cn 
converges, then :I:an converges. 
(b) If an~ dn ~ 0 for n ~ N0, and 1f :I:dn diverges, then :I:an diverges. 
Note that (b) applies only to series of nonnegative terms an. 
Proof Given e &gt; 0, there exists N ~ N0 such that m ~ n ~ N implies 
by the Cauchy criterion. Hence 
m m 
~ L I ak I ~ L ck ~ B, 
k=n k=n 
and (a) follows. 
Next, (b) follows from (a), for if :I:an converges, so must :I:dn [note 
that (b) also follows from Theorem 3.24]. 
1 The expression ''nonnegative'' always refers to real numbers. NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SERIES 61 
The comparison test is a very useful one; to use it efficiently, we have to 
become familiar with a number of series of nonnegative terms whose conver&#173;
gence or divergence is known. 
SERIES OF NONNEGATIVE TERMS 
The simplest of all is perhaps the geometric series.

The result follows if we let n ---+ oo. For x = 1, we get 
1+1+1+&#183;&#183;&#183;, 
which evidently diverges. 
In many cases which occur in applications, the terms of the series decrease 
monotonically. The following theorem of Cauchy is therefore of particular 
interest. The striking feature of the theorem is that a rather ''thin'' subsequence 
of {an} determines the convergence or divergence of l:a".

2.45 Definition Two subsets A and B of a metric space X are said to be 
separated if both A n Band An Bare empty, i.e., if no point of A lies in the 
closure of Band no point of B lies in the closure of A. 
A set E c X is said to be connected if E is not a union of two nonempty 
separated sets. 
2.46 Remark Separated sets are of course disjoint, but disjoint sets need not 
be separated. For example, the interval [O, 1] and the segment (1, 2) are not 
separated, since 1 is a limit point of (1, 2). However, the segments (0, 1) and 
(1, 2) are separated.

2.47 Theorem A subset E of the real line R1 is connected if and only if it has the

Proof If there exist x e &#163;,ye&#163;, and some z e (x, y) such that z &#162; E, then 
E = A:z u B:z where 
A:z =En (-oo, z), B:z =En (z, oo). BASIC TOPOLOGY 43 
Since x e Az and ye Bz, A and Bare nonempty. Since Az c: (-oo, z) and 
Bz c: (z, oo ), they are separated. Hence E is not connected. 
To prove the converse, suppose Eis not connected. Then there are 
nonempty separated sets A and B such that A u B = E. Pick x e A, y e B, 
and assume (without loss of generality) that x &lt; y. Define 
z = sup (A n [x, y]). 
By Theorem 2.28, z e A; hence z &#162; B. In particular, x ~ z &lt; y. 
If z &#162; A, it follows that x &lt; z &lt; y and z &#162; E. 
If z e A, then z &#162; B, hence there exists z1 such that z &lt; z1 &lt; y and

2.33 Theorem Suppose K c Y c X. Then K is compact relative to X if and 
only if K is compact relative to Y. 
By virtue of this theorem we are able, in many situations, to regard com&#173;
pact sets as metric spaces in their own right, without paying any attention to 
any embedding space. In particular, althot1gh it makes little sense to talk of 
open spaces, or of closed spaces (every metric space Xis an open subset of itself, 
and is a closed subset of itself), it does make sense to talk of compact metric 
spaces. 
(22) 
(23) Proof Suppose K is compact relative to X, and let { Va} be a collection 
of sets, open relative to Y, such that Kc U&#171; Va. By theorem 2.30, there 
are sets Ga, open relative to X, such that Va = Y n G &#171;, for all (X; and since 
K is compact relative to X, we have 
for some 
implies KC Ga1 U &#8226; &#183; &#8226; U G&#171;n 
choice of finitely many indices ct1, &#8226;&#8226;. , (Xn. Since Kc Y, (22) 
K C Va, U &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; U Van&#8226; 
This proves that K is compact relative to Y. 
Conversely, suppose K is compact relative to Y, let { Ga} be a col&#173;
lection of open subsets of X which covers K, and put Va = Y n Ga. Then 
(23) will hold for some choice of ct1, ... , (Xn; and since Va c Ga, (23) 
implies (22). 
This completes the proof. 
2.34 Theorem Compact si,bset.fi of metric spaces are closed. 
Proof Let K be a compact subset of a metric space X. We shall prove 
that the complement of K is an open subset of X. 
Suppose p E X, p &#162; K. If q E K, let Vq and Wq be neighborhoods of p 
and q, respectively, of radius less than }d(p, q) [see Definition 2.18(a)]. 
Since K is compact, there are finitely many points q1, &#8226;&#8226;. , qn in K such that 
K C wq1 U " " " U Wqn = w. 
If V = Vq1 n &#183; &#183; &#183; n Vq", then Vis a neighborhood of p which does not 
intersect W. Hence V c Kc, so that p is an interior point of Kc. The 
theorem follows. 
2.35 Theorem Closed subsets of compact sets are compact. 
Proof Suppose F c Kc X, Fis closed (relative to X), and K is compact. 
Let { Va} be an open cover of F. If pc is adjoined to { Va}, we obtain an 38 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
open cover n of K. Since K is compact, there is a finite subcollection Cl&gt; 
of n which covers K, and hence F. If pc is a member of Cl&gt;, we may remove 
it from Cl&gt; and still retain an open cover of F. We have thus shown that a 
finite subcollection of { Voi} covers F. 
Corollary If Fis closed and K is compact, then F n K is compact. 
Proof Theorems 2.24(b) and 2.34 show that F n K is closed; since 
F n Kc: K, Theorem 2.35 shows that F n K is compact. 
2.36 Theorem If { Ka} is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space X such 
that the intersection of every finite subcollection of {Ka} is nonempty, then n Ka 
is nonempty. 
Proof Fix a member Ki of {K.} and put G. = K!. Assume that no point 
of K1 belongs to every .K &#8226;. Then the sets G. form an open cover of Ki; 
and since Ki is compact, there are finitely many indices (X1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , (Xn such 
that K1 c: G.1 u &#183; &#183; &#183; u G.n. But this means that 
K 1 n K.1 n &#183; &#183; &#183; n Koin 
is empty, in contradiction to our hypothesis. 
Corollary If {Kn} is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that Kn =&gt; Kn+ 1 
(n = 1, 2, 3 &#8226;... ), then ni Kn is not empty. 
2.37 Theorem If E is an infinite subset of a compact set K, then E has a limit 
point in K. 
Proof If no point of K were a limit point of E, then each q e K would 
have a neighborhood Vq which contains at most one point of E (namely, 
q, if q e E). It is clear that no finite subcollection of {Vq} can cover E; 
and the same is true of K, since E c: K. This contradicts the compactness 
of K. 
2.38 Theorem If {In} is a sequence of intervals in R1, such that In=&gt; In+t 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ), then ni In is not empty. 
Proof If In = [an, bn], let E be the set of all an. Then E is nonempty and 
bounded above (by b1). Let x be the sup of E. If m and n are positive 
integers, then 
an ::5: am+n ::5: bm+n ::5:bm, 
so that x ::5: bm for each m. Since it is obvious that am ::5: x, we see that 
x e Im form = l, 2, 3, .... BASIC TOPOLOGY 39 
2.39 Theorem Let k be a positive integer. If {In} is a sequence of k-cells such 
that In=&gt; In+1(n = I, 2, 3, ... ), then n;_io In is not empty. 
Proof Let In consist of all points x = (x1, &#8226;.. , xk) such that 
an,}~ X1 ~ bn,J (I ~j ~ k; n = I, 2, 3, ... ), 
and put In,J = [an,J, bn,1]. For each j, the sequence {In,J} satisfies the 
hypotheses of Theorem 2.38. Hence there are real numbers xj(l ~j ~ k) 
such that 
an,J ~xj ~ bn,J (1 ~j ~ k; n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
Setting x* = (x!, ... , xt), we see that x* e In for n = I, 2, 3, . . . . The 
theorem follows. 
2.40 Theorem Every k-cell is compact. 
Proof Let I be a k-cell, consisting of all points x = (x1, ..&#8226; , xk) such 
that a1 ~x1 ~ b1 (1 ~j ~ k). Put 
1/2 
&#8226; 
Then I x -y I ~ b, if x e /, y e I. 
Suppose, to get a contradiction, that there exists an open cover {Ga} 
of I which contains no finite subcover of /. Put c1 = (a1 + b1)(2. The 
intervals [a1, c1] and [c1, b1] then determine 2k k-cells Qi whose union is I. 
At least one of these sets Qi, call it /1, cannot be covered by any finite 
subcollection of {Ga} (otherwise I could be so covered). We next subdivide 
I1 and continue the process. We obtain a sequence {In} with the following 
properties: 
(a) I=&gt; 11 =&gt; 12 =&gt; /3 =&gt; &#183; &#8226; &#8226; ; 
(b) In is not covered by any finite subcollection of {Ga}; 
(c) ifxe/nandye/n, then lx-yl ~2-nb. 
By (a) and Theorem 2.39, there is a point x* which lies in every In. 
For some tx, x* e Ga. Since Ga is open, there exists r &gt; 0 such that 
I y -x* I &lt; r implies that ye Ga. If n is so large that 2-nb &lt; r (there is 
such an n, for otherwise 2n ~ b/r for all positive integers n, which is 
absurd since R is archimedean), then ( c) implies that In c Ga, which con&#173;
tradicts (b). 
This completes the proof. 
The equivalence of (a) and (b) in the next theorem is known as the Heine&#173;
Borel theorem. 40 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
2.41 Theorem If a set E in Rk has one of the following three properties, then it 
has the other two: 
(a) Eis closed and bounded. 
(b) Eis compact. 
(c) Every infinite subset of E has a limit point in E. 
Proof If (a) holds, then E c / for some k-cell /, and (b) follows from 
Theorems 2.40 and 2.35. Theorem 2.37 shows that (b) implies (c). It 
remains to be shown that (c) implies (a). 
If E is not bounded, then E contains points Xn with 
(n = 1, 2, 3, ... ). 
The set S consisting of these points xn is infinite and clearly has no limit 
point in Rk, hence has none in E. Thus (c) implies that Eis bounded. 
If E is not closed, then there is a point x0 e Rk which is a limit point 
of E but not a point of E. For n = 1, 2, 3, ... , there are points xn e E 
such that I xn -x0 I &lt; 1/n. Let S be the set of these points xn. Then Sis 
infinite ( otherwise I xn -x0 I would have a constant positive value, for 
infinitely many n), S has x0 as a limit point, and S has no other limit 
point in Rk. For if ye Rk, y "::/: x0, then 
I Xn -Y I ~ I Xo -Y I -I Xn -Xo I 
1 1 
~ I Xo -YI -~ ~ 2 I Xo -Y I 
for all but finitely many n; this shows that y is not a limit point of S 
(Theorem 2.20). 
Thus S has no limit point in E; hence E must be closed if (c) holds. 
We should remark, at this point, that (b) and (c) are equivalent in any 
metric space (Exercise 26) but that (a) does not, in general, imply (b) and (c). 
Examples are furnished by Exercise 16 and by the space !t'2, which is dis&#173;
cussed in Chap. 11. 
2.42 Theorem (Weierstrass) Every bounded infinite subset of Rk has a limit 
point in Rk. 
Proof Being bounded, the set E in question is a subset of a k-cell / c Rk. 
By Theorem 2.40, / is compact, and so E has a limit point in I, by 
Theorem 2.37. BASIC TOPOLOGY 41 
PERFECT SETS 
2.43 Theorem Let P be a nonempty perfect set in Rk. Then Pis uncountable. 
Proof Since P has limit points, P must be infinite. Suppose P is count&#173;
able, and denote the points of P by x1, x2, x3, .&#8226;.. We shall construct a 
sequence { Vn} of neighborhoods, as follows. 
Let V1 be any neighborhood of x1&#8226; If V1 consists of all y e Rk such 
that I y -x1 I &lt; r, the closure V1 of V1 is the set of all ye Rk such that 
IY-X1I ~r. 
Suppose Vn has been constructed, so that Vn n Pis not empty. Since 
every point of Pis a limit point of P, there is a neighborhood Vn+i such 
that (i) Yn + 1 C: vn , ( ii) Xn &#162; Yn + 1, (iii) Vn + 1 n p is not empty. By (iii), 
Vn+i satisfies our induction hypothesis, and the construction can proceed. 
Put Kn = Yn n P. Since Yn is closed and bounded, Yn is compact. 
Since Xn &#162; Kn+l, no point of plies in n'? Kn. Since Kn C: P, this implies 
that nf Kn is empty. But each Kn is nonempty, by (iii), and Kn=&gt; Kn+t, 
by (i); this contradicts the Corollary to Theorem 2.36. 
Corollary Every interval [a, b] (a &lt; b) is uncountable. In particular, the set of 
all real numbers is uncountable. 
2.44 The Cantor set The set which we are now going to construct shows 
that there exist perfect sets in R1 which contain no segment. 
Let E0 be the interval [O, l]. Remove the segment (&#189;, f), and let E1 be 
the union of the intervals 
[O, t] [t, 1 ]. 
Remove the middle thirds of these intervals, and let E2 be the union of the 
intervals 
[0, &#189;], [&#190;, &#190;], [t, &#190;], [!, 1]. 
Continuing in this way, we obtain a sequence of compact sets En, such that 
(a) E1 =&gt; E2 =&gt; E3 =&gt; &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ; 
(b) En is the union of 2n intervals, each of length 3-n. 
The set 
00 
P= n En 
n= 1 
is called the Cantor set. Pis clearly compact, and Theorem 2.36 shows that P 
is not empty. </description></item><item><title>10 Summation by Parts</title><num_pages>2</num_pages><link>/app/basics/rudin/chap3/10_Summation_by_Parts.pdf</link><description>NUMERICAL SEQUENCES AND SER.IES 59 
3.21 Definition Given a sequence {an}, we use the notation 
n=p 
to denote the sum aP + ap+l + &#183; &#183; &#183; + aq. With {an} we associate a sequence 
{sn}, where 
For {sn} we also use the symbolic expression 
a1 + a2 + a3 + ... 
or, more concisely, 
00 
(4) Lan. 
n=l 
The symbol (4) we call an in.finite series, or just a series. The numbers 
Sn are called the partial sums of the series. If {sn} converges to s, we say that 
the series converges, and write 
00 
Lan= s. 
n= 1 
The number s is called the sum of the series; but it should be clearly under&#173;
stood that s is the limit of a sequence of sums, and is not obtained simply by 
addition. 
If {sn} diverges, the series is said to diverge. 
Sometimes, for convenience of notation, we shall consider series of the 
form 
00 
(5) Lan. 
n=O 
And frequently, when there is no possible ambiguity, or when the distinction 
is immaterial, we shall simply write :I:an in place of (4) or (5). 
It is clear that every theorem about sequences can be stated in terms of 
series (putting a1 = s1, and an = Sn -Sn -i for n &gt; 1 ), and vice versa. But it is 
nevertheless useful to consider both concepts. 
The Cauchy criterion (Theorem 3.11) can be restated in the following 
form: 
3.22 Theorem :I:an converges if and only if for every B &gt; 0 there is an integer 
N such that 
(6) 
if m ~ n ~ N. 60 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
In particular, by taking m = n, (6) becomes 
I an I ~ B (n ~ N). 
In other words: 
3.23 Theorem lf :I:an converges, then limn&#10132;oo an = 0. 
The condition an&#10132; 0 is not, however, sufficient to ensure convergence 
of :I:an. For instance, the series 
CX) 1 I -
n= 1 n 
diverges; for the proof we refer to Theorem 3.28. 
Theorem 3.14, concerning monotonic sequences, also has an immediate 
counterpart for series. 
3.24 Theorem A series of nonnegative1 terms converges if and only if its 
partial sums form a bounded sequence. 
We now tum to a convergence test of a different nature, the so-called 
''comparison test." 
3.25 Theorem 
(a) If I an I ~ Cn for n ~ N0, where N0 is some fixed integer, and if :I:cn 
converges, then :I:an converges. 
(b) If an~ dn ~ 0 for n ~ N0, and 1f :I:dn diverges, then :I:an diverges. 
Note that (b) applies only to series of nonnegative terms an. 
Proof Given e &gt; 0, there exists N ~ N0 such that m ~ n ~ N implies 
by the Cauchy criterion. Hence 
m m 
~ L I ak I ~ L ck ~ B, 
k=n k=n 
and (a) follows. 
Next, (b) follows from (a), for if :I:an converges, so must :I:dn [note 
that (b) also follows from Theorem 3.24].

The rapidity with which the series L 1 converges can be estimated as n! 
follows: If sn has the same meaning as above, we have 
1 1 1 e-s =---+---+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; n (n + 1) ! (n + 2) ! (n + 3) ! 
1 1 1 1 &lt;---1+--+---+&#183;&#183;&#183; =-(n + 1) ! n + 1 (n + 1)2 n !n

n n!n 
Thus s10, for instance, approximates e with an error less than 10-1. The 
inequality (16) is of theoretical interest as well, since it enables us to prove the 
irrationality of e very easily. 
3.32 Theorem e is irrational. 
(17) Proof Suppose e is rational. Then e = p/q, where p and q are positive 
integers. By (16), 
1 0 &lt;q!(e-sq) &lt;-&#183; q 
By our assumption, q!e is an integer. Since 
q!sq = q! 1 1 l+l+-+&#183;&#183;&#183;+-2 ! q! 
is an integer, we see that q!(e -sq) is an integer. 
Since q ~ l, (17) implies the existence of an integer between O and 1. 
We have thus reached a contradiction. 
Actually, e is not even an algebraic number. For a simple proof of this, 
see page 25 of Niven's book, or page 176 of Herstein's, cited in the Bibliography.

Since O &lt; /J &lt; 1, 'E/Jn converges. Convergence of '&#163;an follows now from

3.36 Remarks The ratio test is frequently easier to apply than the root test, 
since it is usually easier to compute ratios than nth roots. However, the root 
test has wider scope. More precisely: Whenever the ratio test shows conver&#173;
gence, the root test does too; whenever the root test is inconclusive, the ratio 
test is too. This is a consequence of Theorem 3.37, and is illustrated by the 
above examples. 
Neither of the two tests is subtle with regard to divergence. Both deduce
